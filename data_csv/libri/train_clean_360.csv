train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0001.flac,THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET

train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0007.flac,NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0008.flac,IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0009.flac,SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0011.flac,AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0019.flac,BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0026.flac,A GOOD BEATING AND TOM WAS SO SCARED THAT HE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL HE CAME TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE AND HE BAWLED LUSTILY THE WHOLE WAY AND CRIED OUT AT EVERY STEP
train-clean-360/100/121669/100-121669-0029.flac,THAN WHEN HE STOLE THE PIG TO GET A DINNER AND SUFFERED A SEVERE BEATING AS A PUNISHMENT
train-clean-360/100/121674/100-121674-0016.flac,AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS SOMETHING NEW AMONGST THEM ONCE I VISITED SANTA AND SAW HIM MAKE THE TOYS

train-clean-360/100/121674/100-121674-0026.flac,AND HE TALKED TO ME IN SUCH A JOLLY WAY THAT I SAT PERFECTLY STILL AND ALLOWED HIM TO MEASURE MY EARS AND MY LEGS SO THAT HE COULD CUT THE FUR INTO THE PROPER FORM
train-clean-360/100/121674/100-121674-0027.flac,AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
train-clean-360/100/121674/100-121674-0030.flac,AND AT FIRST I DID N'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS THE LIVE RABBIT OR THE TOY RABBIT WE WERE SO MUCH ALIKE

train-clean-360/1413/121799/1413-121799-0045.flac,BY THE AID OF ANALYSIS IT CAN BE SHOWN
train-clean-360/1413/121799/1413-121799-0047.flac,IN THIS CASE WE ARE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THE DREAM CARRIES ON THE CHIEF INTEREST OF OUR WAKING LIFE MORE USUALLY HOWEVER
train-clean-360/1413/121799/1413-121799-0048.flac,IT IS SO TRIVIAL UNIMPORTANT AND SO DESERVING OF OBLIVION THAT WE CAN ONLY RECALL IT WITH AN EFFORT

train-clean-360/1639/133290/1639-133290-0015.flac,BUT MORE PARTICULARLY OF A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE MAJORITY AND MORE PARTICULARLY OF THAT PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS MOST EXPOSED TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF WANT
train-clean-360/1639/133290/1639-133290-0016.flac,AND MISERY IS APT TO STIMULATE IT TO THOSE EXCESSES TO WHICH AMBITION ROUSES KINGS
train-clean-360/1639/133290/1639-133290-0018.flac,WHICH THEY WERE OBLIGED TO SUBJUGATE BEFORE THEY COULD FLOURISH IN THEIR PLACE EVEN THE MODERNS HAVE FOUND IN SOME PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA

train-clean-360/1639/133290/1639-133290-0060.flac,AND THEY SET AN ESPECIAL VALUE UPON A REGULAR CONDUCT WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF A SOLID BUSINESS
train-clean-360/1639/133290/1639-133290-0061.flac,GENERAL IDEAS ALARM THEIR MINDS WHICH ARE ACCUSTOMED TO POSITIVE CALCULATIONS AND THEY HOLD PRACTICE IN MORE HONOR THAN THEORY

train-clean-360/1668/136280/1668-136280-0066.flac,THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TIN BOX I BELIEVE I LOST A GREAT PART OF THE RESULT OF SIX YEARS OF LIFE WITH WILD NATURE
train-clean-360/1678/142279/1678-142279-0001.flac,AND A HEART AT LEISURE FROM ITSELF TO SOOTHE AND SYMPATHISE

train-clean-360/17/362/17-362-0033.flac,AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
train-clean-360/17/362/17-362-0034.flac,AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
train-clean-360/17/362/17-362-0036.flac,NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
train-clean-360/17/362/17-362-0041.flac,HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
train-clean-360/17/362/17-362-0042.flac,I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROM SOMEONE IN SPORT

train-clean-360/17/363/17-363-0031.flac,AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0011.flac,WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIFE THERE AND HERE SHE WAS GETTING SURFEITED OF THE EVENTLESS EASE IN WHICH NO STRUGGLE OR ENDEAVOUR WAS REQUIRED
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0022.flac,IF SHE COULD NOT ASSIST WITH HER ADVICE AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF NOTES TO WRITE WHICH EDITH INVARIABLY LEFT TO HER

train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0060.flac,HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0067.flac,MISTER BELL GOT UP AND LOOKED AROUND HIM FOR HIS HAT WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TEA

train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0086.flac,IT GAVE A NEW DIRECTION TO HIS THOUGHTS YOU HAVE KNOWN MISS HALE FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVE
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0100.flac,THAT LAST DAY AT HELSTONE ONLY HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET ANXIOUS IN ORDER TO LULL CERTAIN QUALMS OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0101.flac,MISTER BELL GROWLED OUT
train-clean-360/1705/142318/1705-142318-0103.flac,AND I WAS BORN THERE YET I DO ASSURE YOU I OFTEN LOSE MY WAY AYE AMONG THE VERY PILES OF WAREHOUSES THAT ARE BUILT UPON MY FATHER'S ORCHARD DO WE PART HERE
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0031.flac,THESE HOWEVER FAR FROM CONCEALING IT OR RENDERING IT UNRECOGNIZABLE RATHER BRING IT OUT BY CONTRAST AND MAKE IT SHINE FORTH SO MUCH THE BRIGHTER
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0033.flac,SINCE THEY EVEN CONFLICT WITH IT I ALSO SET ASIDE THOSE ACTIONS WHICH REALLY CONFORM TO DUTY BUT TO WHICH MEN HAVE NO DIRECT INCLINATION
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0034.flac,FOR IN THIS CASE WE CAN READILY DISTINGUISH WHETHER THE ACTION WHICH AGREES WITH DUTY IS DONE FROM DUTY OR FROM A SELFISH VIEW
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0038.flac,THEY PRESERVE THEIR LIFE AS DUTY REQUIRES NO DOUBT BUT NOT BECAUSE DUTY REQUIRES
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0045.flac,IF HE SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPRIGHT MAN IS BY TEMPERAMENT COLD AND INDIFFERENT TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE IN RESPECT OF HIS OWN
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0047.flac,WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY THE HIGHEST OF ALL NAMELY THAT HE IS BENEFICENT NOT FROM INCLINATION BUT FROM DUTY
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0052.flac,CAN CHOOSE TO ENJOY WHAT HE LIKES AND TO SUFFER WHAT HE MAY SINCE ACCORDING TO HIS CALCULATION ON THIS OCCASION AT LEAST
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0056.flac,FOR LOVE AS AN AFFECTION CANNOT BE COMMANDED BUT BENEFICENCE FOR DUTY'S SAKE MAY
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0061.flac,FOR THE WILL STANDS BETWEEN ITS A PRIORI PRINCIPLE WHICH IS FORMAL AND ITS A POSTERIORI SPRING WHICH IS MATERIAL AS BETWEEN TWO ROADS
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0068.flac,A MAXIM IS THE SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLE OF VOLITION
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0069.flac,THAT WHICH WOULD ALSO SERVE SUBJECTIVELY AS A PRACTICAL PRINCIPLE TO ALL RATIONAL BEINGS IF REASON HAD FULL POWER OVER THE FACULTY OF DESIRE
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0074.flac,IT IS NOT A FEELING RECEIVED THROUGH INFLUENCE
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0075.flac,AND THEREFORE IS SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT FROM ALL FEELINGS OF THE FORMER KIND WHICH MAY BE REFERRED EITHER TO INCLINATION OR FEAR
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0077.flac,AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS IS CALLED RESPECT
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0078.flac,RESPECT IS PROPERLY
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0079.flac,WHICH THWARTS MY SELF LOVE
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0083.flac,THAT MY MAXIM SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSAL LAW HERE NOW IT IS THE SIMPLE CONFORMITY TO LAW IN GENERAL
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0089.flac,IT IS A WHOLLY DIFFERENT THING TO BE TRUTHFUL FROM DUTY AND TO BE SO FROM APPREHENSION OF INJURIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN THE FIRST CASE THE VERY NOTION OF THE ACTION
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0095.flac,IN ORDER THAT MY WILL MAY BE MORALLY GOOD INEXPERIENCED IN THE COURSE OF THE WORLD INCAPABLE OF BEING PREPARED FOR ALL ITS CONTINGENCIES I ONLY ASK MYSELF
train-clean-360/1724/395/1724-395-0112.flac,WHICH FORCES IT TO SEEK AID IN PHILOSOPHY JUST AS HAPPENS TO IT IN ITS THEORETIC USE

train-clean-360/1731/142320/1731-142320-0040.flac,BUT AT THE END THE BEWILDERED WOMAN SIMPLY REPEATED HER FIRST ASSERTION NAMELY THAT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR SURE AND SHE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO IT
train-clean-360/1731/142320/1731-142320-0045.flac,THE LADY HELD OUT A HAND TO MISTER BELL WITH

train-clean-360/1731/142320/1731-142320-0053.flac,AND SEE THE THE WORD IMPROVEMENTS HAD HALF SLIPPED OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE SUBSTITUTED THE MORE CAUTIOUS TERM ALTERATIONS WHICH THE PRESENT VICAR WAS MAKING
train-clean-360/1731/142320/1731-142320-0054.flac,THE PARSONAGE WAS SO ALTERED BOTH INSIDE AND OUT THAT THE REAL PAIN WAS LESS THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED IT WAS NOT LIKE THE SAME PLACE THE GARDEN THE GRASS PLAT

train-clean-360/1734/142311/1734-142311-0022.flac,OF ALL FAULTS THE ONE SHE MOST DESPISED IN OTHERS WAS THE WANT OF BRAVERY THE MEANNESS OF HEART WHICH LEADS TO UNTRUTH

train-clean-360/1734/142311/1734-142311-0033.flac,IF NOT THEN AT LEAST THE VERY FIRST EVENING THAT MISTER THORNTON COULD COMMAND THEY SHOULD MEET FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION MISTER HALE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MEETING EVER SINCE THEY HAD PARTED

train-clean-360/1769/143483/1769-143483-0011.flac,SUFFICIENTLY INFORMS ME THAT I AM GOING TO SPEAK TO MEN FOR TO THOSE ALONE WHO ARE NOT AFRAID OF HONOURING TRUTH IT BELONGS TO PROPOSE DISCUSSIONS OF THIS KIND
train-clean-360/1769/143483/1769-143483-0012.flac,I CONCEIVE TWO SPECIES OF INEQUALITY AMONG MEN ONE WHICH I CALL NATURAL OR PHYSICAL INEQUALITY BECAUSE IT IS ESTABLISHED BY NATURE AND CONSISTS IN THE DIFFERENCE OF AGE
train-clean-360/1769/143483/1769-143483-0014.flac,ALL OF THEM IN FINE CONSTANTLY HARPING ON WANTS AVIDITY OPPRESSION DESIRES AND PRIDE HAVE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE OF NATURE IDEAS PICKED UP IN THE BOSOM OF SOCIETY
train-clean-360/1769/143483/1769-143483-0015.flac,THOUGH IT PLAINLY APPEARS BY SACRED HISTORY THAT EVEN THE FIRST MAN IMMEDIATELY FURNISHED AS HE WAS BY GOD HIMSELF WITH BOTH INSTRUCTIONS AND PRECEPTS NEVER LIVED IN THAT STATE
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0009.flac,HAD HE A SLING WOULD IT DART A STONE TO SO GREAT A DISTANCE
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0013.flac,THAT NOTHING IS MORE FEARFUL THAN MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE THAT HE IS ALWAYS IN A TREMBLE AND READY TO FLY AT THE FIRST MOTION HE PERCEIVES AT THE FIRST NOISE THAT STRIKES HIS EARS
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0019.flac,ONE WAY TO LOOK OUT FOR THEIR OWN SUBSISTENCE AND ANOTHER TO SUCKLE AND FEED THEIR YOUNG ONES
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0021.flac,SO THAT IN THIS RESPECT TOO ALL THINGS ARE IN A MANNER EQUAL
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0030.flac,WE MAY ADD THAT THERE MUST BE STILL A WIDER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IN A SAVAGE AND DOMESTIC CONDITION THAN BETWEEN BEAST AND BEAST
train-clean-360/1769/143484/1769-143484-0033.flac,AND IN COLD CLIMATES THEY SOON LEARN TO APPLY TO THAT USE THOSE OF THE ANIMALS THEY HAVE CONQUERED

train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0001.flac,THAT NATURE ALONE OPERATES IN ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BEAST WHEREAS MAN AS A FREE AGENT HAS A SHARE IN HIS ONE CHOOSES BY INSTINCT
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0003.flac,THUS A PIGEON WOULD STARVE NEAR A DISH OF THE BEST FLESH MEAT AND A CAT ON A HEAP OF FRUIT OR CORN
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0005.flac,THE WILL STILL CONTINUES TO DICTATE
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0009.flac,THERE IS ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC QUALITY THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM AND A QUALITY WHICH WILL ADMIT OF NO DISPUTE THIS IS THE FACULTY OF IMPROVEMENT A FACULTY WHICH
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0010.flac,AS CIRCUMSTANCES OFFER SUCCESSIVELY UNFOLDS ALL THE OTHER FACULTIES AND RESIDES AMONG US NOT ONLY IN THE SPECIES BUT IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COMPOSE IT
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0012.flac,CONTINUES ALWAYS IN POSSESSION OF HIS INSTINCT MAN LOSING BY OLD AGE OR BY ACCIDENT ALL THE ACQUISITIONS HE HAD MADE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PERFECTIBILITY
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0015.flac,WOULD THEREFORE BEGIN WITH FUNCTIONS THAT WERE MERELY ANIMAL
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0020.flac,TO WHICH NATURE HAD LEFT THE INHABITANTS EXPOSED OR TO WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES HAD SUBJECTED THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE PASSIONS WHICH INCLINED THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THESE WANTS
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0028.flac,AND WHICH DOES NOT SO MUCH SERVE TO DRAW ALIMENTS FROM THE EARTH FOR THE EARTH WOULD YIELD THEM WITHOUT ALL THAT TROUBLE AS TO OBLIGE HER TO PRODUCE THOSE THINGS WHICH WE LIKE BEST PREFERABLY TO OTHERS
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0030.flac,AFTER ALL THESE FINE PRESENTS WHAT MAN WOULD BE MAD ENOUGH TO CULTIVATE A FIELD THAT MAY BE ROBBED BY THE FIRST COMER MAN OR BEAST WHO TAKES A FANCY TO THE PRODUCE OF IT

train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0040.flac,THE MOTHER SUCKLED HER CHILDREN WHEN JUST BORN FOR HER OWN SAKE BUT AFTERWARDS OUT OF LOVE AND AFFECTION TO THEM WHEN HABIT AND CUSTOM HAD MADE THEM DEAR TO HER
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0041.flac,IT IS HE THAT MUST BE AT THE CHIEF EXPENSE OF INVENTION
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0043.flac,FOR TO SAY THAT THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE DICTATED TO THE CHILD THE WORDS HE MUST EMPLOY TO ASK HER THIS THING AND THAT
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0049.flac,WHEN THE IDEAS OF MEN BEGAN TO EXTEND AND MULTIPLY AND A CLOSER COMMUNICATION BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE AMONG THEM
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0050.flac,THEY MULTIPLIED THE INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE AND ADDED TO THEM GESTURES WHICH ARE IN THEIR OWN NATURE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND WHOSE MEANING DEPENDS LESS ON ANY PRIOR DETERMINATION
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0054.flac,A SUBSTITUTION WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN MADE BY COMMON CONSENT AND IN A MANNER PRETTY DIFFICULT TO PRACTISE BY MEN WHOSE RUDE ORGANS WERE UNIMPROVED BY EXERCISE
train-clean-360/1769/143485/1769-143485-0056.flac,WE MUST ALLOW THAT THE WORDS FIRST MADE USE OF BY MEN HAD IN THEIR MINDS A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE SIGNIFICATION THAN THOSE EMPLOYED IN LANGUAGES OF SOME STANDING

train-clean-360/1776/139035/1776-139035-0021.flac,AND THE MYSTERY OF DEATH ALL THESE THINGS MUST HAVE EXCITED THE WONDER OF THESE EARLY PHILOSOPHERS
train-clean-360/1776/139035/1776-139035-0022.flac,IN THE MOST PRACTICAL FORM BY THE IMPORTUNATE DEMANDS OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO EXPECTED THEM NOT MERELY TO UNDERSTAND BUT TO REGULATE THE GREAT PROCESSES OF NATURE FOR THE GOOD OF MAN
train-clean-360/1776/139035/1776-139035-0023.flac,THAT THEIR FIRST SHOTS FELL VERY FAR WIDE OF THE MARK COULD HARDLY BE HELPED THE SLOW THE NEVER ENDING APPROACH TO TRUTH CONSISTS IN PERPETUALLY FORMING AND TESTING HYPOTHESES
train-clean-360/1776/139035/1776-139035-0035.flac,SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE BY NO MEANS CONFINED AS THE CULTIVATED READER MIGHT IMAGINE TO THE NAKED INHABITANTS OF THOSE SULTRY LANDS LIKE CENTRAL AUSTRALIA AND SOME PARTS OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA

train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0002.flac,IF WE ARE TO KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER OF OTHER PEOPLE OF THE PAST BEFORE OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMORY BEGINS OR OF THE FUTURE WE MUST KNOW GENERAL PRINCIPLES
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0006.flac,WE ARE ALL CONVINCED THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW WHY
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0008.flac,WE SHALL NATURALLY ANSWER BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAS RISEN EVERY DAY WE HAVE A FIRM BELIEF
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0017.flac,THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF SOME UNIFORM SUCCESSION OR COEXISTENCE HAS BEEN A CAUSE OF OUR EXPECTING THE SAME SUCCESSION OR COEXISTENCE ON THE NEXT OCCASION
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0024.flac,EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE FUTURE FROM THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS ANY REASONABLE GROUND FOR GIVING WEIGHT TO SUCH EXPECTATIONS AFTER THE QUESTION OF THEIR VALIDITY HAS BEEN RAISED
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0028.flac,ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT BALLOONS AND AEROPLANES CAN RISE
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0029.flac,THE BELIEF THAT THE SUN WILL RISE TO MORROW MIGHT BE FALSIFIED IF THE EARTH CAME SUDDENLY INTO CONTACT WITH A LARGE BODY WHICH DESTROYED ITS ROTATION
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0030.flac,THE BUSINESS OF SCIENCE IS TO FIND UNIFORMITIES
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0036.flac,THE QUESTION WE REALLY HAVE TO ASK IS WHEN TWO THINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE OFTEN ASSOCIATED
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0037.flac,DOES THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OF THE TWO IN A FRESH INSTANCE GIVE ANY GOOD GROUND FOR EXPECTING THE OTHER
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0047.flac,AND WILL MAKE IT APPROACH CERTAINTY WITHOUT LIMIT AS JUST STATED THE PRINCIPLE APPLIES ONLY TO THE VERIFICATION OF OUR EXPECTATION
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0048.flac,THAT THINGS OF THE SORT A ARE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS OF THE SORT B PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CASES OF ASSOCIATION ARE KNOWN AND NO CASES OF FAILURE OF ASSOCIATION ARE KNOWN
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0055.flac,THAT SOME DATA RENDER IT IMPROBABLE
train-clean-360/1776/142744/1776-142744-0056.flac,IS PECULIARLY LIABLE TO ERROR BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE A FRESH DATUM

train-clean-360/1777/142745/1777-142745-0012.flac,BUT THE FACT THAT THINGS BEHAVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM IN OTHER WORDS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE THINK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM WE THINK TRULY BUT THIS IS A LARGE QUESTION TO WHICH WE MUST RETURN AT A LATER STAGE

train-clean-360/1777/142745/1777-142745-0034.flac,RATHER THAN OF TWO COINS OR TWO BOOKS OR TWO PEOPLE OR TWO OF ANY OTHER SPECIFIED KIND BUT AS SOON AS WE ARE ABLE TO DIVEST OUR THOUGHTS OF IRRELEVANT PARTICULARITY
train-clean-360/1777/142745/1777-142745-0048.flac,AND EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS SUCH AS ALL MEN ARE MORTAL IN REGARD TO THE FORMER DEDUCTION IS THE RIGHT MODE OF ARGUMENT
train-clean-360/1777/142745/1777-142745-0051.flac,HOW CAN THERE BE KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PROPOSITIONS IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE NOT EXAMINED ALL THE INSTANCES AND INDEED NEVER CAN EXAMINE THEM ALL BECAUSE THEIR NUMBER IS INFINITE

train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0008.flac,GREAT WAS HIS GRIEF WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HER TO SAIL AWAY NOT LONG HAD SHE BEEN GONE HOWEVER
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0009.flac,HIS CHIEF COMPANION THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW AFTER HER AND ASK FOR HER HAND HIS SHIP WAS PREPARED
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0010.flac,HIS REQUEST WAS NOT GRANTED AND HELGE DISMISSED HIM CONTEMPTUOUSLY IN A RAGE AT THE INSULT FRITHIOF LIFTED HIS SWORD
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0012.flac,BUT HE HASTENED AT ONCE TO INGEBORG
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0020.flac,BUT MANY OF THE CREW WERE WORN OUT BY THE BATTLE WITH THE ELEMENTS AND HAD TO BE CARRIED ASHORE BY FRITHIOF AND BJOERN WHEN THEY REACHED THE ORKNEY ISLANDS
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0021.flac,COULD WEATHER SUCH A STORM ONE OF HIS VASSALS
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0023.flac,BUT WHEN HE RETURNED AND FOUND HIS OPPONENT CALMLY AWAITING DEATH HE WAS GENEROUS
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0025.flac,SAILED BACK TO THE KINGS OF SOGN CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD WIN INGEBORG WHAT WAS HIS DISMAY THEREFORE
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0026.flac,TO SIGURD RING IN A RAGE HE BADE HIS MEN DESTROY ALL THE VESSELS IN THE HARBOR
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0027.flac,WHERE HELGE AND HIS WIFE WERE
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0028.flac,AND SEEING THE RING HE HAD GIVEN TO INGEBORG ON THE HAND OF HELGE'S WIFE SNATCHED IT ROUGHLY FROM HER IN TRYING TO GET IT BACK
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0030.flac,HURRIED AWAY TO HIS SHIP SO FRITHIOF BECAME AN EXILE AND A WANDERER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0033.flac,LANDING HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN AN OLD CLOAK AND APPROACHED THE COURT HE FOUND A SEAT ON A BENCH NEAR THE DOOR AS BEGGARS USUALLY DID
train-clean-360/2269/147627/2269-147627-0041.flac,AND LATER SO THE STORY RUNS HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BUILT AGAIN THE TEMPLE OF BALDER
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0003.flac,OF CLOWNISH MEMORY HIS FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN OF RANK AND FORTUNE AND GREATLY BELOVED AND RESPECTED BY ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCE
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0009.flac,HE WAS ALIKE REMARKABLE FOR THE POLITENESS OF HIS MANNERS AND HIS AGREEABLE ADDRESS FOR HE HAD SUCH A TREACHEROUS MEMORY
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0011.flac,OR TAKE OFF HIS HAT AND WHEN HE WAS TOLD OF IT EITHER BY HIS PARENTS OR HIS MASTER HE WOULD
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0012.flac,GRINNING AND LEERING THE WHOLE TIME
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0016.flac,WITH SUCH A DELICATE DISPOSITION AND SUCH AMIABLE TALENTS YOU WILL READILY PERCEIVE THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN A MOST AGREEABLE PLAY FELLOW
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0019.flac,IT MUST HOWEVER BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS A YOUTH OF SUCH IMPARTIAL JUSTICE
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0027.flac,BUT WHOEVER DRAWS SUCH A CONCLUSION IN FAVOUR OF OUR HERO DICKY RUSTICK IS GREATLY MISTAKEN
train-clean-360/2269/165387/2269-165387-0035.flac,HE SWAGGERED DOWN AGAIN UPON HIS FORE PAWS AND BY A SULLEN GROWL SEEMED TO CLAIM THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROMISE
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0006.flac,AND THE MOMENT HE OPENED HIS MOUTH I KNEW THAT MY TIME HAD COME AND THAT THERE WAS A VERY FAIR CHANCE OF VICTORY BEFORE ME
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0007.flac,I CANNOT SAY BUT HIS READING WAS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE WIND IN AN EQUINOCTIAL GALE
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0019.flac,AND TO HAVE KEPT ME TO HERSELF WOULD HAVE REQUIRED FAR MORE STRENGTH AND UNSELFISHNESS THAN SHE AT THAT MOMENT POSSESSED
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0024.flac,DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IF YOUR BROTHER IS AT HOME I WANT JUST TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE CHOIR TREAT
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0029.flac,WAS AS YET ALTOGETHER CRUDE AND YOUNG WAS IT ABOUT ANYTHING IN YOUR DISTRICT
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0033.flac,MISSUS O'REILLY HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU HE ASKED WITH SOME CURIOSITY WHY SHE HAS FOUND OUT THAT HE IS REALLY A NIHILIST
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0035.flac,YOU CAN'T THINK HOW UNHAPPY SHE IS ABOUT POOR GERTRUDE AND SO AM I
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0039.flac,AND THEN SHE TALKED OF LEAVING IT TO CHANCE
train-clean-360/2269/88761/2269-88761-0043.flac,AND SO EAGER TO SPREAD THE STORY BUT MY PROGENITOR IS CLEVER AND DOUBTLESS KNOWS VERY WELL WHOM TO SELECT AS HIS TOOLS
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0008.flac,THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0027.flac,BUT ACTIVE AND METHODICAL HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0035.flac,AND THE MUSIC WHICH SIR THOMAS CALLED FOR FROM HIS DAUGHTERS HELPED TO CONCEAL THE WANT OF REAL HARMONY
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0042.flac,AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0048.flac,AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0049.flac,WHO WANTED NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0053.flac,SHE WAS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO DISPENSE WITH ANY OTHER REVENGE SHE DID NOT WANT EXPOSURE TO BE ADDED TO DESERTION HENRY CRAWFORD GONE SHE COULD EVEN PITY HER SISTER
train-clean-360/227/126539/227-126539-0056.flac,SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE INDIFFERENT TO MISTER CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0001.flac,AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0005.flac,IS SHE ILL I HOPE NOT HE REPLIED
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0007.flac,ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING ALMOST THIS MOMENT THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0009.flac,AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0011.flac,EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0018.flac,ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0020.flac,BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0021.flac,SAID SHE AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART DOES HE TRAVEL IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0024.flac,IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0027.flac,PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS FOR HIM AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0031.flac,AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0033.flac,I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0037.flac,IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR ENGAGEMENT IF THEY ARE ENGAGED FROM MISSUS SMITH AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
train-clean-360/227/129974/227-129974-0058.flac,THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT
train-clean-360/2272/150674/2272-150674-0003.flac,THE FIRST INTRODUCTION OF A SYMBOLIC WORSHIP WAS IN THE VENERATION OF THE CROSS AND OF RELICS THE SAINTS AND MARTYRS WHOSE INTERCESSION WAS IMPLORED

train-clean-360/2272/152264/2272-152264-0011.flac,IN A LITTLE TIME A BODY OF SOLDIERS CAME TO HIM AND A STRONG FORT WAS BUILT BY THEM
train-clean-360/2272/152264/2272-152264-0014.flac,BUT BETTER THAN THAT HE HAD GAINED INFORMATION THAT WAS OF THE GREATEST VALUE IN A WEEK HE ATTACKED THE DANISH FORCES AND DEFEATED THEM WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER IN A BATTLE WHICH LASTED ALL DAY AND FAR INTO THE NIGHT
train-clean-360/2272/152264/2272-152264-0017.flac,ERECTED NEW FORTS AND GREATLY STRENGTHENED HIS ARMY AND NAVY

train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0021.flac,BELIEF WAS THE ONLY FORM EXERTION COULD TAKE WITH HIM IT WOULD BE BECAUSE IT WAS AN ENTERPRISING THING
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0049.flac,BUT SHE HAD NEVER GUESSED SO HAPPILY AS THAT ISABEL'S SATISFACTIONS JUST NOW WERE FEW BUT EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN MORE NUMEROUS
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0052.flac,WITH THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DELAY
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0076.flac,WHEN ONE REALLY THINKS OF IT THE COOL INSOLENCE OF THAT PERFORMANCE WAS SOMETHING RARE HE COMES AND LOOKS AT ONE'S DAUGHTER AS IF SHE WERE A SUITE OF APARTMENTS
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0087.flac,JUST AS HE HAD BEEN DRESSED ON THAT DAY
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0088.flac,AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS FAMILIAR LOOK THERE WAS A STRANGENESS IN HIS FIGURE TOO SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FEEL IT AFRESH
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0091.flac,AND SHE WAS HAPPY TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHOW HIM CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION
train-clean-360/2348/143895/2348-143895-0097.flac,HE WANTED TO DO NOTHING BUT SAIL ON THE BIG BOATS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TOGETHER FROM NEW YORK TO MILWAUKEE STOPPING AT THE MOST INTERESTING CITIES ON THE ROUTE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0004.flac,IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER EDISON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND FILED TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0007.flac,AND THEREBY PRODUCED A SYSTEM BY MEANS OF WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD BE SENT OVER A SINGLE LINE AT THE SAME TIME TWO IN EACH DIRECTION
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0010.flac,INTRODUCED FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS OF COMPREHENSION WHILE THE APPARATUS AND THE CIRCUITS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0022.flac,REPEATING THE MESSAGES RECEIVED IN ITS COILS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0027.flac,AND ITS POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0029.flac,ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THE BAR TO BE END ON TOWARD THE OBSERVER THAT END WILL BE A SOUTH POLE IF THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BAR
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0030.flac,OR A NORTH POLE IF FLOWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ILLUSTRATED AT THE RIGHT OF THE FIGURE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0031.flac,THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF POLARITY BEING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0034.flac,HENCE IF WE CONNECT ONE POLE OF A BATTERY WITH THE EARTH AND FROM THE OTHER POLE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0035.flac,EQUAL CURRENTS WILL TRAVERSE THE WIRES
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0041.flac,IF ANOTHER BATTERY D BE INTRODUCED AT THE DISTANT END OF THE WIRE A THE DIFFERENTIAL OR NEUTRAL RELAY BECOMES ACTIVELY OPERATIVE AS FOLLOWS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0042.flac,THE DISTANT STATION TO WHICH A MESSAGE IS TO BE SENT THE RELAY AT EACH END HAS TWO COILS ONE AND TWO
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0047.flac,SIMILAR EFFECTS WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM B TO A IF THE BATTERY AND KEY WERE PLACED AT THE B END
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0050.flac,AND SEPARATE BATTERY THE ARMATURE LEVER L IS LONG PIVOTED IN THE CENTRE AND IS BENT OVER AT THE END
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0052.flac,AND ATTACHED TO THE LOWER END OF THIS BENT PIECE IS A POST OR STANDARD TO WHICH THE MAIN BATTERY IS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0062.flac,AS APPLIED TO THE LINE AND THUS PRODUCING CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE POLARITY OF ANOTHER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED TYPE OF RELAY CALLED A POLARIZED RELAY
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0064.flac,THE THEORY OF THE POLARIZED RELAY GENERALLY CALLED POLAR
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0065.flac,WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0069.flac,THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POLARITY ALSO REVERSES AND THE END OF THE PERMANENT MAGNET SWINGS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0071.flac,A CONTACT AND A BACK STOP THE FORMER OF WHICH IS OPENED AND CLOSED BY THE SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET THUS OPENING AND CLOSING THE LOCAL CIRCUIT
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0079.flac,THUS FAR WE HAVE REFERRED TO TWO SYSTEMS ONE THE NEUTRAL OR DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0080.flac,BY ONE OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS A SINGLE WIRE COULD BE USED FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND BY THE OTHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0081.flac,TWO IN EACH DIRECTION THUS EMPLOYING EIGHT OPERATORS FOUR AT EACH END TWO SENDING AND TWO RECEIVING
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0083.flac,COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0085.flac,IN THAT IT DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE OPERATION OF THE KEY AT THE HOME OFFICE BUT ONLY OPERATES IN RESPONSE TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DISTANT KEY
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0089.flac,AN IDEA OF THEIR COMPLEXITY MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS QUOTED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0093.flac,PARTLY BY THE HOME BATTERY PARTLY BY THE DISTANT AND HOME BATTERIES COMBINED PARTLY BY CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0096.flac,A HINT AS TO AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEUTRAL RELAY AS USED IN THE DUPLEX AND AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX MAY BE GIVEN
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0104.flac,IS OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIVE TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A POWERFUL CURRENT
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0107.flac,THE QUADRUPLEX WAS ALSO ARRANGED TO OPERATE ON THE WHEATSTONE BRIDGE PRINCIPLE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0113.flac,IF THE MAKE AND BREAK OF THE MAGNETIZING CURRENT BE RAPID THE VIBRATIONS BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE HUMAN EAR THE DIAPHRAGM WILL PRODUCE AN AUDIBLE SOUND
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0115.flac,WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IN THE TELEPHONE
train-clean-360/2364/131735/2364-131735-0116.flac,CORRESPONDING TO THE SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BUT THIS CURRENT IS TOO WEAK TO AFFECT THE TELEGRAPH RELAY
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0001.flac,AS USUAL HE TOOK THE NINE O'CLOCK WATCH AND AT MIDNIGHT DICK RELIEVED HIM KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT DICK WAS THE DOCTOR'S GOOD NIGHT INJUNCTION
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0002.flac,NO BUT I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD VAGUE SOUNDS BELOW US AND
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0004.flac,AND HE NOTICED NOTHING MORE IT WAS NO DOUBT ONE OF THOSE LUMINOUS ILLUSIONS THAT SOMETIMES IMPRESS THE EYE IN THE MIDST OF VERY PROFOUND DARKNESS
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0005.flac,SO HE MERELY SAW THAT HIS WEAPONS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THEN WITH HIS NIGHT GLASS AGAIN PLUNGED HIS GAZE INTO SPACE
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0006.flac,AND THEN BY THE AID OF A RAY OF MOONLIGHT THAT SHOT LIKE AN ELECTRIC FLASH BETWEEN TWO MASSES OF CLOUD HE DISTINCTLY MADE OUT A GROUP OF HUMAN FIGURES MOVING IN THE SHADOW
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0008.flac,AND IN THE MEANWHILE ADDED THE DOCTOR I WILL TAKE MY MEASURES SO THAT WE CAN ASCEND RAPIDLY AT A MOMENT'S WARNING AGREED LET US GO DOWN THEN SAID JOE DON'T USE YOUR WEAPONS EXCEPTING AT THE LAST EXTREMITY
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0010.flac,YES SOMETHING'S COMING UP TOWARD US CLIMBING
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0011.flac,THE TWO FRIENDS COULD EVEN CATCH THE SOUND OF A FEW WORDS UTTERED IN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE TONES JOE GENTLY BROUGHT HIS RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER AS HE SPOKE WAIT SAID KENNEDY
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0012.flac,SOME OF THE NATIVES HAD REALLY CLIMBED THE BAOBAB AND NOW THEY WERE SEEN RISING ON ALL SIDES WINDING ALONG THE BOUGHS LIKE REPTILES AND ADVANCING SLOWLY BUT SURELY
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0015.flac,A HUMAN VOICE HAD DISTINCTLY CALLED ALOUD IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE HELP HELP KENNEDY AND JOE DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT HAD REGAINED THE CAR IMMEDIATELY DID YOU HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0018.flac,DO YOU HEAR DOCTOR RESUMED KENNEDY SEIZING THE DOCTOR'S HAND SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD KILL HIM TO NIGHT
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0019.flac,THEY MUST HAVE THE SUNSHINE NOW IF I WERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS TO SLIP DOWN TO THE POOR FELLOW SAID KENNEDY AND I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID JOE WARMLY PAUSE MY FRIENDS PAUSE
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0024.flac,AS FOR YOU MY DEAR DICK WITH DETERMINED DARING AND PROFITING BY THEIR ALARM AT OUR FIRE ARMS YOUR PROJECT MIGHT POSSIBLY SUCCEED
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0027.flac,SINCE THE BAGS WE BROUGHT WITH US ARE STILL UNTOUCHED I'LL SUPPOSE THAT THIS PRISONER WHO IS EVIDENTLY EXHAUSTED BY SUFFERING WEIGHS AS MUCH AS ONE OF US
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0028.flac,THIS IS THE IDEA DICK YOU WILL ADMIT THAT IF I CAN GET TO THE PRISONER AND THROW OUT A QUANTITY OF BALLAST
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0030.flac,BUT THIS DARKNESS IT HIDES OUR PREPARATIONS AND WILL BE DISPERSED ONLY WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED TAKE CARE TO HAVE ALL OUR WEAPONS CLOSE AT HAND PERHAPS WE MAY HAVE TO FIRE
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0031.flac,BUT PERHAPS WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO ALL THIS NOISY WORK ARE YOU READY WE'RE READY RESPONDED JOE THE SACKS WERE PLACED AS REQUESTED
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0032.flac,VERY GOOD SAID THE DOCTOR HAVE AN EYE TO EVERY THING JOE WILL SEE TO THROWING OUT THE BALLAST AND DICK WILL CARRY OFF THE PRISONER BUT LET NOTHING BE DONE UNTIL I GIVE THE WORD
train-clean-360/2368/157054/2368-157054-0034.flac,HE THEN TOOK OUT THE TWO PERFECTLY ISOLATED CONDUCTING WIRES WHICH SERVED FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WATER AND SEARCHING IN HIS TRAVELLING SACK BROUGHT FORTH TWO PIECES OF CHARCOAL
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0002.flac,IS GROWING WEAKER STILL AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HIM SAID THE DOCTOR DESPAIRINGLY
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0003.flac,AND TO THINK THAT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS GOOD MAN COULD FIND WORDS ONLY TO PITY THEM TO EXCUSE TO PARDON THEM HEAVEN HAS GIVEN HIM A LOVELY NIGHT JOE HIS LAST ON EARTH PERHAPS
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0005.flac,MY FRIENDS SAID HE IN AN ENFEEBLED VOICE I AM GOING MAY GOD REQUITE YOU AND BRING YOU TO YOUR SAFE HARBOR
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0014.flac,THE BODY OF THE MARTYRED MISSIONARY WAS THEN SOLEMNLY PLACED IN IT THE EARTH WAS THROWN IN OVER HIS REMAINS
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0015.flac,THE DOCTOR HOWEVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND LOST IN HIS REFLECTIONS
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0016.flac,THAT PRIEST WHO TOOK THE OATH OF PERPETUAL POVERTY NOW REPOSES IN A GOLD MINE A GOLD MINE EXCLAIMED KENNEDY AND JOE IN ONE BREATH YES A GOLD MINE SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0019.flac,WHAT SAID JOE AGAIN ABANDON THESE TREASURES A FORTUNE FOR US REALLY FOR US OUR OWN LEAVE IT BEHIND TAKE CARE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU YIELD TO THE THIRST FOR GOLD
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0020.flac,ALL THAT IS TRUE REPLIED JOE BUT GOLD MISTER KENNEDY WON'T YOU HELP TO GATHER UP A TRIFLE OF ALL THESE MILLIONS WHAT COULD WE DO WITH THEM JOE SAID THE HUNTER UNABLE TO REPRESS A SMILE
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0023.flac,AN AUSTRALIA AND A CALIFORNIA BOTH TOGETHER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDERNESS AND THE WHOLE OF IT IS TO REMAIN USELESS PERHAPS BUT AT ALL EVENTS HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO TO CONSOLE YOU
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0024.flac,AH MASTER I GIVE UP I SEE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0025.flac,WILL BE SO MUCH MADE AND JOE WENT TO WORK HE DID SO TOO WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SOON HAD COLLECTED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PIECES OF QUARTZ
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0026.flac,LAY IN TWENTY TWO DEGREES TWENTY THREE MINUTES EAST LONGITUDE AND FOUR DEGREES FIFTY FIVE MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0027.flac,HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAR HE WOULD HAVE ERECTED A PLAIN RUDE CROSS OVER THE TOMB LEFT SOLITARY THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE AFRICAN DESERTS
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0028.flac,GOD WILL RECOGNIZE IT SAID KENNEDY AN ANXIETY OF ANOTHER SORT NOW BEGAN TO STEAL OVER THE DOCTOR'S MIND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH OF THE GOLD BEFORE HIM FOR A LITTLE WATER
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0031.flac,DO ME THE KINDNESS TO THROW OUT SOME OF THAT QUARTZ BUT DOCTOR YOU GAVE ME LEAVE I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO REPLACE THE BALLAST THAT WAS ALL BUT
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0034.flac,JOE GOT VERY PALE POOR FELLOW SAID THE DOCTOR
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0035.flac,SINCE IT WAS PUT IN HERE TO MAKE UP FOR US THROW AWAY FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS SAID JOE PITEOUSLY
train-clean-360/2368/157056/2368-157056-0038.flac,THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A MINE AS THAT WOULD CAUSE IT IS SAD TO THINK OF IT
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0001.flac,THE BALLOON HAVING BEEN MADE FAST TO A SOLITARY TREE ALMOST COMPLETELY DRIED UP BY THE ARIDITY OF THE REGION IN WHICH IT STOOD
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0002.flac,IN ALL THIS VAST EXTENT OF COUNTRY I HOPE SO
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0004.flac,FOR THERE WHOLE WEEKS SOMETIMES PASS WITHOUT THE CARAVANS MEETING WITH A SINGLE SPRING OF WATER
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0005.flac,THESE ANXIETIES AND THE INCIDENTS RECENTLY OCCURRING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT THEIR EFFECT UPON THE SPIRITS OF OUR THREE TRAVELLERS
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0007.flac,NOT EVEN A COLLECTION OF A FEW HUTS AND VEGETATION ALSO WAS DISAPPEARING
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0008.flac,THEN CAME THE FIRST TRACT OF GRAYISH SAND AND FLINT
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0009.flac,THESE SYMPTOMS OF A TOTALLY DRY AND BARREN REGION GREATLY DISQUIETED DOCTOR FERGUSON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO CARAVAN HAD EVER BRAVED THIS DESERT EXPANSE
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0010.flac,BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND WAS TO BE SEEN AND THE AERONAUTS FELT THAT ERE LONG AN IMMENSITY OF SAND WOULD COVER THE WHOLE OF THIS DESOLATE REGION
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0012.flac,YET THE CYLINDER CONSUMED ABOUT NINE CUBIC FEET PER HOUR
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0013.flac,FIFTY FOUR HOURS SAID THE DOCTOR TO HIS COMPANIONS THEREFORE AS I AM DETERMINED NOT TO TRAVEL BY NIGHT
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0015.flac,THE LATTER BEING MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THAN TO QUENCH THIRST
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0017.flac,AND NOT A SIGN OF CHANGE WAS VISIBLE IN THE MOTIONLESS SKY
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0018.flac,THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THIS INTENSE HEAT BY RISING INTO A HIGHER RANGE BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONSUME A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER A THING THAT HAD NOW BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0019.flac,THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A LITTLE DRIED MEAT AND PEMMICAN
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0020.flac,WE CANNOT GO ANY FASTER SAID THE DOCTOR WE NO LONGER COMMAND WE HAVE TO OBEY AH DOCTOR HERE IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN A PROPELLER WOULD NOT BE A THING TO BE DESPISED
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0022.flac,BUT THE HUNDRED POUNDS OF WATER THAT WE THREW OVERBOARD WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO US NOW
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0023.flac,OR QUITE ENOUGH TO CARRY US OVER THIS DESERT
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0024.flac,IN DISTANCE YES BUT IN DURATION NO SHOULD THE WIND LEAVE US AND IT EVEN NOW HAS A TENDENCY TO DIE AWAY ALTOGETHER
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0025.flac,THE SOIL HOWEVER RAN LOWER FROM MILE TO MILE THE UNDULATIONS OF THE GOLD BEARING MOUNTAINS THEY HAD LEFT DIED AWAY INTO THE PLAIN LIKE THE LAST THROES OF EXHAUSTED NATURE
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0026.flac,ONLY A FEW BELTS OF HALF SCORCHED HERBAGE
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0028.flac,DO YOU SEE HE ADDED LAUGHING I HAD NO CONFIDENCE FOR MY PART IN YOUR FORESTS AND YOUR PRAIRIES
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0030.flac,BUT THE DAYS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER WITH DESPERATE MONOTONY
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0033.flac,BUT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIS DISQUIET TO APPEAR THOSE TWO MEN DICK AND JOE
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0037.flac,HE THEREUPON LAID THE WHOLE STATE OF THE CASE PLAINLY BEFORE THEM
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0040.flac,AND WITH THIS THE THREE FRIENDS WARMLY GRASPED EACH OTHER BY THE HAND NOW HEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR ACCORDING TO MY SOLAR OBSERVATIONS
train-clean-360/2368/157057/2368-157057-0042.flac,WHOSE HORIZONTAL RAYS STRETCHED IN LONG LINES OF FIRE OVER THE FLAT IMMENSITY IT WAS THE DESERT
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0000.flac,DOCTOR FERGUSON'S NEW CALCULATIONS KENNEDY'S HUNT
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0001.flac,TANGALIA THE RETURN LARI
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0002.flac,IT WAS A SORT OF ISLAND OF SOLID GROUND IN THE MIDST OF AN IMMENSE MARSH
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0005.flac,AND THE END IS WORTH THE TROUBLE THE DOCTOR AND KENNEDY WENT TO WORK AT ONCE BUT THEY ENCOUNTERED GREAT DIFFICULTY
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0006.flac,THEY CERTAINLY WITNESSED OUR MISFORTUNE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0008.flac,SINCE WE HAD TO SACRIFICE NEARLY ALL THE OLD LOT
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0010.flac,MEANWHILE FERGUSON WAS ENGAGED IN CALCULATING THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THE ARTICLES STILL LEFT IN THE CAR AND IN ESTABLISHING THE EQUIPOISE OF THE SECOND BALLOON
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0013.flac,HE COULD THEN TAKE WITH HIM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS OF BALLAST FOR UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES AND THE BALLOON WOULD BE IN EXACT BALANCE WITH THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0014.flac,AND THE LATTER WERE FINISHED WHEN KENNEDY RETURNED
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0015.flac,HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE TO DRAW AND SMOKE THE GAME
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0018.flac,BUT ALAS THE VOICE THAT THEY SO LONGED TO HEAR WAS FAR AWAY AT THE FIRST STREAK OF DAY THE DOCTOR AROUSED KENNEDY
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0019.flac,HE HE KNOWS US TOO WELL FOR THAT SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD NEVER COME INTO HIS MIND BUT HE MUST BE INFORMED AS TO WHERE WE ARE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0020.flac,WE SHALL GET INTO OUR CAR AND BE OFF AGAIN THROUGH THE AIR BUT SHOULD THE WIND BEAR US AWAY
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0022.flac,AND IF A PRISONER RESUMED THE DOCTOR IT NOT BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE NATIVES TO CONFINE THEIR CAPTIVES HE WILL SEE US AND COMPREHEND THE OBJECT OF OUR RESEARCHES BUT AT LAST PUT IN KENNEDY
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0023.flac,WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO REGAIN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE LAKE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0024.flac,THERE WE'LL WAIT WE'LL EXPLORE THE BANKS WE'LL SEARCH THE WATER'S EDGE FOR JOE WILL ASSUREDLY TRY TO REACH THE SHORE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0025.flac,LET US SET OUT THEN SAID THE HUNTER
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0026.flac,BETWEEN THE VILLAGE OF LARI AND THE VILLAGE OF INGEMINI BOTH VISITED BY MAJOR DENHAM DURING THIS TIME KENNEDY WAS COMPLETING HIS STOCK OF FRESH MEAT
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0027.flac,THE LAMANTINE OR MANATEE AND THE HIPPOPOTAMUS HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A SINGLE SPECIMEN OF THOSE ANIMALS AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0028.flac,THE BALLOON'S ANCHOR WAS DETACHED FROM ITS HOLD THE GAS DILATED AND THE NEW VICTORIA ROSE TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR IT SEEMED TO HESITATE AT FIRST AND WENT SPINNING AROUND LIKE A TOP
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0029.flac,THE DOCTOR CONTINUED TO KEEP AT A HEIGHT OF FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0031.flac,WE CAN SEE NOTHING SAID KENNEDY AFTER TWO HOURS OF SEARCH
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0032.flac,WE CANNOT BE FAR AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF OUR ACCIDENT BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE BALLOON HAD GONE NINETY MILES
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0034.flac,NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD THE CASE SEEMED DESPERATE
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0035.flac,FOR IN SUCH CASE HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUND MEANS TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE THERE KNOWN PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED TO THE MAINLAND THE DOCTOR WAS REASONING THUS TO HIMSELF WHEN HE AGAIN CAME IN SIGHT
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0036.flac,CAYMANS SWARM IN THESE WATERS BUT NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER HAD THE COURAGE TO DISTINCTLY COMMUNICATE THIS IMPRESSION
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0038.flac,HE PREFERRED KEEPING QUIET TO DISCUSSING THIS TERRIBLE POSSIBILITY
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0039.flac,CONSTRUCTED OF WOVEN REEDS AND STANDING IN THE MIDST OF CLEAN AND NEATLY KEPT ENCLOSURES
train-clean-360/2368/157066/2368-157066-0040.flac,THE ANCHOR INSTEAD OF CATCHING THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0000.flac,FROM A HISTORICAL AND PICTURESQUE POINT OF VIEW
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0001.flac,IS THEIR EFFECT UPON THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0002.flac,THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE FORMED BY CHANCE COMBINATIONS OF CONSPICUOUS STARS LIKE FIGURES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0003.flac,OF COSMIC EXISTENCE WE SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT THE KALEIDOSCOPE OF THE HEAVENS WAS CEASELESSLY TURNING AND THROWING THE STARS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0006.flac,TO THE PASSING GLANCE WHICH IS ALL THAT WE CAN BESTOW UPON THESE FIGURES THEY APPEAR SO IMMUTABLE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0007.flac,IN THE FORMS OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0008.flac,YET IN A BROAD SENSE THIS SCROLL OF HUMAN THOUGHT IMPRINTED ON THE HEAVENS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0009.flac,ALTHOUGH MORE ENDURING THAN PARCHMENT TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND TEMPLES
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0010.flac,OF WHAT MAN HAS FANCIED AND DONE BEFORE STUDYING THE EFFECTS THAT THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS HAVE HAD AND WILL HAVE UPON THE CONSTELLATIONS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0014.flac,WAS CONNECTED WITH THE SIGN OF THE CONSTELLATION KNOWN TO US AS CANCER
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0015.flac,AND CONSUME THE OFFERINGS LEFT UPON THE ALTAR OUR SCORPIO WAS KNOWN TO THE MAYAS AS A SIGN OF THE DEATH GOD OUR LIBRA THE BALANCE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0016.flac,SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH THE MAYAN CONSTELLATION
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0019.flac,BUT IN FACT
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0022.flac,THE ROMANS TRANSLATED NO HEROES AND HEROINES OF THE MYTHICAL PERIOD OF THEIR HISTORY TO THE SKY
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0024.flac,PROFESSOR YOUNG HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REMARKED THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0027.flac,THIS FIGURE IS MADE UP OF SEVEN CONSPICUOUS STARS IN THE CONSTELLATION URSA MAJOR THE GREATER BEAR THE HANDLE OF THE DIPPER
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0028.flac,OF THE SEVEN STARS MENTIONED SIX ARE OF NEARLY EQUAL BRIGHTNESS RANKING AS OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE WHILE THE SEVENTH IS OF ONLY THE THIRD MAGNITUDE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0029.flac,THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE FAINT STAR WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND THE HANDLE IS A VARIABLE OF LONG PERIOD SINCE THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0031.flac,IS THE FAINT STAR ALREADY MENTIONED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE BOWL AND HANDLE AND MIZAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HANDLE HAS A CLOSE NAKED EYE COMPANION WHICH IS NAMED ALCOR
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0032.flac,ARE CALLED THE POINTERS BECAUSE AN IMAGINARY LINE DRAWN NORTHWARD THROUGH THEM INDICATES THE POLE STAR
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0033.flac,WITH ITS COMRADE ARE MOVING WITH PRACTICALLY THE SAME SPEED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION WHILE THE OTHER TWO
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0037.flac,THE FACT THAT THE LITTLE STAR ALCOR PLACED SO CLOSE TO MIZAR SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE LATTER IN ITS FLIGHT IS NOT SURPRISING
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0038.flac,IS SURPRISING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE AND IT RECALLS THE STRANGE THEORY OF A DOUBLE DRIFT AFFECTING ALL THE STARS TO WHICH ATTENTION WAS CALLED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0039.flac,FROM THE GREAT DIPPER WE TURN TO A CONSTELLATION HARDLY LESS CONSPICUOUS AND SITUATED AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE POLE ON THE OTHER SIDE CASSIOPEIA
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0042.flac,AND DIFFERENT OBSERVERS OFTEN VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR RESULTS IN THE BEAUTIFUL NORTHERN CROWN
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0043.flac,THE ALTERNATE COMBINING AND SCATTERING EFFECTS OF THE STELLAR MOTIONS ARE SHOWN BY COMPARING THE APPEARANCE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0048.flac,POSSESS AS FAR AS HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED NO PERCEPTIBLE MOTION ACROSS THE LINE OF SIGHT
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0049.flac,AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS CONSISTS OF AN ALMOST PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE A ROW OF SECOND MAGNITUDE STARS ABOUT EQUALLY SPACED
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0050.flac,IN THE COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER THE TWO RIGHT HAND STARS MINTAKA AND ALNILAM
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0051.flac,WILL APPROACH EACH OTHER AND FORM A NAKED EYE DOUBLE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0058.flac,WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SEEK TO REPRESENT FUTURE APPEARANCES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS WHICH WE COULD NOT HOPE TO SEE EVEN IF WE COULD SURVIVE SO LONG THE ANSWER IS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0059.flac,THE CONSTELLATIONS ARE MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0060.flac,MUST AT ONCE STRIKE THE EYE AND THE IMAGINATION AND MAKE CLEARER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0061.flac,AND IF OUR RACE IS DESTINED TO SURVIVE YET A MILLION YEARS THEN OUR REMOTE DESCENDENTS WILL SEE A NEW HEAVENS
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0062.flac,IF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIVE DISTANCES OF THE STARS WERE MORE COMPLETE IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXERCISE IN CELESTIAL GEOMETRY TO PROJECT THE CONSTELLATIONS PROBABLY VISIBLE
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0063.flac,EXCEPT PERHAPS IN A FEW CASES AS SEEN FOR INSTANCE FROM THE NEAREST KNOWN STAR ALPHA CENTAURI
train-clean-360/2388/153728/2388-153728-0064.flac,COULD ONLY RANK AS A FIFTH OR SIXTH MAGNITUDE STAR
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0007.flac,WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS VISIBLE ALL OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE SO THAT SCORES OF ASTRONOMERS SAW IT
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0011.flac,THAT THERE WAS AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING IN ITS SINGULAR AND WONDERFUL APPEARANCE THAT WAS APPALLING BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE ATTENDING THE PHENOMENON
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0012.flac,APPARENTLY EMANATING FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE MOON BUT EVIDENTLY FORMING A PORTION OF THE CORONA
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0013.flac,PERHAPS THE COLOR OF THE PEACH BLOSSOM WOULD MORE NEARLY REPRESENT IT
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0016.flac,YET ON BOTH OCCASIONS
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0018.flac,CROWDED ON THE CITADEL HILL OF BURGOS WITH THEIR KING AND HIS ROYAL RETINUE IN THEIR MIDST
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0019.flac,THERE ARE RECOGNIZED TWO KINDS OF PROMINENCES THE ERRUPTIVE AND THE QUIESCENT
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0027.flac,MIGHT NOT REACH THE PLANETS HERE THEN WE HAVE ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE EXPLOSIONS
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0028.flac,BUT THEY EVIDENTLY HAVE AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH ERUPTIVE PROMINENCES
train-clean-360/2388/153731/2388-153731-0029.flac,EVIDENCES OF A CYCLONIC TENDENCY HAVE BEEN FOUND

train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0007.flac,STALKING LIKE AN APPARITION IN THE MIDST
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0009.flac,INDICATING THAT THE APPARITION WAS ABOUT
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0015.flac,AND THE OCEAN CABLES CEASED TO WORK
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0016.flac,THE ANCIENT ZURICH CHRONICLES EXTENDING FROM THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN WHICH BOTH SUN SPOTS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE

train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0026.flac,BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AN INADMISSIBLE QUANTITY OF ENERGY WAS DEMANDED TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ACTION BUT NO CALCULATION LIKE THAT
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0028.flac,DECLARED THAT AERIAL NAVIGATION WAS AN IMPRACTICABLE DREAM AND DEMONSTRATED ITS IMPRACTICABILITY BY CALCULATION HOWEVER THE CONNECTION MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0029.flac,AND COINCIDENT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THE INFERENCE
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0030.flac,SHOULD IT BE SO DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUN'S ENORMOUS ELECTRIC ENERGIES FIND A WAY TO US ALSO NO DOUBT THE IMPULSE COMING FROM THE SUN
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0033.flac,THEY BEGIN TO DESCEND WITH THE LINES OF FORCE CURVING DOWN TO MEET AT THE POLES AND ENCOUNTERING A PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE COMPARABLE IN DENSITY

train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0041.flac,THIS AS WILL BE SEEN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE IS IN STRICT ACCORD WITH THE OBSERVED VARIATIONS IN THE FREQUENCY OF AURORAE
train-clean-360/2388/153733/2388-153733-0042.flac,IN THE WINTER THAN IN THE SUMMER AND THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES REACHING IT WILL VARY LIKE THE INTENSITY OF LIGHT

train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0000.flac,CHAPTER NINETEEN MAGNETIC ORE MILLING WORK DURING THE HUDSON FULTON CELEBRATION OF OCTOBER NINETEEN O NINE BURGOMASTER VAN LEEUWEN
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0004.flac,LOW GRADE IRON ORE AS CARRIED ON AT EDISON NEW JERSEY PROVED TO BE THE MOST COLOSSAL EXPERIMENT THAT HE HAS EVER MADE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0007.flac,IN OTHER WORDS MISTER EDISON WAS AT LEAST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AHEAD OF THE TIMES IN THE WORK NOW TO BE CONSIDERED
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0009.flac,AND THAT BUSINESS WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING WESTWARD
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0011.flac,AND UPON FOREIGN ORES WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY RISING IN VALUE BEGAN TO SUSTAIN A SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WESTERN MILLS EVEN IN EASTERN MARKETS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0021.flac,NOT ONLY DID HE DEVELOP THOROUGHLY THE REFINING OF THE CRUSHED ORE SO THAT AFTER IT HAD PASSED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MAGNETS IN THE MILL THE CONCENTRATES CAME OUT FINALLY CONTAINING NINETY ONE TO NINETY THREE PER CENT
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0025.flac,GRAPPLING WITH TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER HIS GENIUS AS AN INVENTOR IS REVEALED IN MANY DETAILS OF THE GREAT CONCENTRATING PLANT BUT TO OUR MIND
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0027.flac,HAVING DETERMINED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS OF NEW JERSEY I CONSTRUCTED A VERY SENSITIVE MAGNETIC NEEDLE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0032.flac,WE ALSO KNEW THE WIDTH LENGTH AND APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF EVERY ONE OF THESE DEPOSITS WHICH WERE ENORMOUS THE AMOUNT OF ORE DISCLOSED BY THIS SURVEY WAS SIMPLY FABULOUS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0035.flac,MINGLED IN ITS MASS AND THIRD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS AT A COST SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO GIVE THE PRODUCT A COMMERCIAL VALUE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0036.flac,WHILE THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF THE HUMAN HAND UPON THE MATERIAL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE TREATMENT TO ITS FINISH
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0038.flac,ALL OF THE DIVERSE AND COMPLEX MACHINERY OF THE ENTIRE CONCENTRATING PLANT AS SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLETED
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0042.flac,THE FAITH THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS HAD A NEW OPPORTUNITY IN WORK OF THIS NATURE IT HAD BEEN CUSTOMARY AS ABOVE STATED TO DEPEND UPON A HIGH EXPLOSIVE SUCH AS DYNAMITE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0043.flac,THIS HOWEVER HE DEEMED TO BE A MOST UNECONOMICAL PROCESS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0047.flac,IT IS NOT EASY TO APPRECIATE TO THE FULL THE DARING EXEMPLIFIED IN THESE GREAT CRUSHING ROLLS OR RATHER ROCK CRACKERS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0061.flac,AND WHICH PRACTICALLY REVERSED THE ABOVE FIGURES AS IT DEVELOPED EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT OF WORK DONE WITH ONLY SIXTEEN PER CENT LOSS IN FRICTION A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE WILL PROBABLY INTEREST THE READER
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0062.flac,IN THE TWO END PIECES OF A HEAVY IRON FRAME WERE SET THREE ROLLS OR CYLINDERS ONE IN THE CENTRE ANOTHER BELOW AND THE OTHER ABOVE ALL THREE BEING IN A VERTICAL LINE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0064.flac,IN WHICH WAS RUN A HALF INCH ENDLESS WIRE ROPE THIS ROPE WAS WOUND SEVEN TIMES OVER THE SHEAVES AS ABOVE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0065.flac,AND IN THIS MANNER THE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE ROLLS IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFORE THAT THE SYSTEM CONSISTED IN A SINGLE ROPE PASSED OVER SHEAVES AND SO ARRANGED THAT IT COULD BE VARIED IN LENGTH
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0071.flac,THE CONCENTRATE IN FINE POWDERY FORM WAS DELIVERED IN SIMILAR MANNER TO A STOCK HOUSE AS TO THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS WE MAY NOW QUOTE AGAIN FROM THE ARTICLE IN THE IRON AGE
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0075.flac,WHILE THEY WERE SO POROUS AS TO BE CAPABLE OF ABSORBING TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF THEIR OWN VOLUME IN ALCOHOL BUT REPELLING WATER ABSOLUTELY PERFECT OLD SOAKS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0076.flac,THUS WITH NEVER FAILING PERSISTENCE AND PATIENCE COUPLED WITH INTENSE THOUGHT AND HARD WORK EDISON MET AND CONQUERED ONE BY ONE THE COMPLEX DIFFICULTIES THAT CONFRONTED HIM
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0078.flac,TWO POINT FIVE SEVEN TWO
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0079.flac,ON THE NINTH AT FIVE P M THE BRIQUETTES HAVING BEEN NEARLY EXHAUSTED THE PERCENTAGE WAS DROPPED TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND ON THE TENTH THE OUTPUT DROPPED TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TONS
train-clean-360/2774/131722/2774-131722-0084.flac,WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING ALONG WITH THE IRON ORE CONCENTRATION I WENT TO SEE SEVERAL BLAST FURNACE MEN TO SELL THE ORE AT THE MARKET PRICE THEY SAW I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SELL IT AND THEY WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY NECESSITY

train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0009.flac,THREE TONS IN HER CELLAR AND AS SOON AS HER VISITOR HAD LEFT HER THIS MORNING SHE POPPED OUT TO SEE MISTER WOOTTEN HER COAL MERCHANT
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0016.flac,AND ALL THE TIME ELIZABETH'S OWN CELLARS WERE GLUTTED THOUGH SHE HAD ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS ALMOST FUELLESS
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0017.flac,AS THE COOLING PROCESS WENT ON SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER IT WAS WORSTED ALONE THAT HAD PROMPTED HER FRIEND'S DIABOLICAL SUGGESTION
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0019.flac,LUCK EVER ATTENDS THE BOLD AND CONSTRUCTIVE THINKER THE APPLE FOR INSTANCE FELL FROM THE TREE PRECISELY WHEN NEWTON'S MIND WAS GROPING AFTER THE LAW OF GRAVITY
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0020.flac,FOR SHE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH ROSES EVER SINCE BREAKFAST THE ATTENDANT WAS AT THE TELEPHONE AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP HE SPOKE IN A LUCID TELEPHONE VOICE
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0021.flac,HER VOICE WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANXIETY AND INVESTIGATION GOT ANY BIG TINS OF CORNED BEEF THE ONES THAT CONTAIN SIX POUNDS
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0023.flac,FOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE GROCER'S BOY CAME OUT OF THE SHOP WITH A HEAVY BASKET ON HIS ARM
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0024.flac,THAT LED TO MISS MAPP'S HOUSE WAS VERY PROTRACTED AT THE CORNER HE DELIBERATELY PUT DOWN THE BASKET ALTOGETHER
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0026.flac,HE RANG THE BELL AT MISS MAPP'S BACK DOOR
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0028.flac,HE PUT THE BASKET ON HIS HEAD AND CAME DOWN THE STREET AGAIN SHRILLY WHISTLING
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0030.flac,IT BECAME A MATTER OF THRILLING INTEREST AS TO WHERE SHE KEPT THESE STORES SHE COULD NOT KEEP THEM IN THE COAL CELLAR FOR THAT WAS ALREADY BURSTING WITH COAL
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0032.flac,BUT THAT COULD SCARCELY BE THE SITE OF THIS PRODIGIOUS CACHE FOR IT WAS FULL OF CARDBOARD AND CURTAINS AND CARPETS AND ALL THE RUBBISHY ACCUMULATIONS WHICH ELIZABETH COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0033.flac,THEN SHE HAD LARGE CUPBOARDS IN HER BEDROOM AND SPARE ROOMS FULL TO OVERFLOWING OF MOULDY CLOTHES
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0034.flac,AND SHE CRUSHED HER TEMPLES IN HER HANDS IN THE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE HIDING PLACE OF THE HOARD
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0038.flac,HAD NOTICED A MODEST CATCH LET INTO THE WOODWORK
train-clean-360/2853/164188/2853-164188-0039.flac,DOUBT THEN THE BOOKCASE WAS THE DOOR OF THE CUPBOARD AND WITH A STROKE OF INTUITION TOO SURE TO BE CALLED A GUESS
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0003.flac,BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0006.flac,YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO BE A BOY WAS IN HER EYES TO BE SOMETHING WRONG TO BEGIN WITH
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0008.flac,MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0009.flac,WOULD TURN AGAIN TO HIS BOOK OR HIS SERMON SAYING VERY WELL MISSUS MITCHELL
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0010.flac,MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE HALF SHE TOLD HIM AT ALL EVENTS
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0017.flac,CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0019.flac,THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0021.flac,OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0022.flac,WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0023.flac,FOR HER FACE I THINK THAT WAS RATHER QUEER
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0024.flac,WHETHER SHE WAS NICE LOOKING OR NOT
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0025.flac,IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0027.flac,BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
train-clean-360/288/121741/288-121741-0028.flac,WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0003.flac,HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0004.flac,OR BY ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL MODE THERE IS NO EXPRESS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THEM TO USE FORCE AGAINST DELINQUENT MEMBERS
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0005.flac,BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0006.flac,THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0010.flac,THE WANT OF A MUTUAL GUARANTY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER CAPITAL IMPERFECTION IN THE FEDERAL PLAN THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DECLARED IN THE ARTICLES THAT COMPOSE IT
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0011.flac,MUST BE RENOUNCED USURPATION MAY REAR ITS CREST IN EACH STATE AND TRAMPLE UPON THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COULD LEGALLY
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0012.flac,A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0013.flac,THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0014.flac,THIS RIGHT WOULD REMAIN UNDIMINISHED
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0015.flac,WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0017.flac,IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE CONFEDERATION
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0018.flac,HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT AND HAS SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED FROM THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BEEN MADE OF IT I SPEAK OF IT NOW SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO EQUALITY AMONG THE STATES
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0019.flac,WHICH PRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE NATIONAL WEALTH MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NO COMMON STANDARD OR BAROMETER BY WHICH THE DEGREES OF IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0022.flac,THE CONSEQUENCE CLEARLY IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO COMMON MEASURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND OF COURSE NO GENERAL OR STATIONARY RULE BY WHICH THE ABILITY OF A STATE TO PAY TAXES CAN BE DETERMINED
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0026.flac,PROPER FOR SUCH IMPOSITIONS IF INEQUALITIES SHOULD ARISE IN SOME STATES FROM DUTIES ON PARTICULAR OBJECTS THESE WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0027.flac,IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0034.flac,IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0035.flac,IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
train-clean-360/288/130994/288-130994-0037.flac,MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
train-clean-360/288/131218/288-131218-0005.flac,AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM

train-clean-360/288/131218/288-131218-0013.flac,A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP

train-clean-360/3008/164327/3008-164327-0001.flac,AS THERE WERE OTHER PATCHES OF TREES OF THE SAME SORT BETWEEN THE GREAT OAKS I ASKED WHY THE MURDERER HAD CHOSEN THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
train-clean-360/3008/164327/3008-164327-0007.flac,THAT HE ADMIRED THE PRUDENT DOUBT WITH WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE APPROACHED THE MOST SIMPLE PROBLEMS RISKING NOTHING BY SAYING THAT IS SO OR THAT IS NOT SO

train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0036.flac,THE CAT AT HER FEET YOU'VE BEEN ILL MOTHER ANGENOUX IS THAT WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK ASKED THE GREEN MAN
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0037.flac,I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP BUT THREE TIMES
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0048.flac,ROULETABILLE RETURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND SAID NOW WE'LL GRILL OUR STEAK
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0049.flac,WE SAW NO MORE OF DADDY MATHIEU THAT DAY AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE INN WHEN WE LEFT IT AFTER PLACING FIVE FRANCS ON THE TABLE IN PAYMENT FOR OUR FEAST
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0050.flac,ROULETABILLE AT ONCE SET OFF ON A THREE MILE WALK ROUND PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S ESTATE HE HALTED FOR SOME TEN MINUTES AT THE CORNER OF A NARROW ROAD BLACK WITH SOOT
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0053.flac,FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0055.flac,SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0056.flac,AND WHETHER HE IS SO MUCH CLEVERER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
train-clean-360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0057.flac,WHO WERE ALSO DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE PARK BUT TWO GENDARMES STATIONED AT THE GATE HAD EVIDENTLY RECEIVED ORDERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION TO ANYBODY
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0000.flac,QUESTION FIFTY
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0003.flac,THEIR SUBSTANCE WE CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY AND IN RELATION TO CORPOREAL THINGS CONCERNING THEIR SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0004.flac,IT WOULD SEEM THAT AN ANGEL IS NOT ENTIRELY INCORPOREAL FOR WHAT IS INCORPOREAL ONLY AS REGARDS OURSELVES AND NOT
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0005.flac,THEREFORE EVERY CREATURE IS CORPOREAL NOW ANGELS ARE GOD'S CREATURES AS APPEARS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0006.flac,HE COMMANDED AND THEY WERE CREATED THEREFORE ANGELS ARE CORPOREAL
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0008.flac,AND THE PERFECT ASSIMILATION OF AN EFFECT TO A CAUSE IS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE EFFECT IMITATES THE CAUSE ACCORDING TO THAT WHEREBY THE CAUSE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0015.flac,FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CONTAINED UNDER ANY GENUS IS COMPOSED OF THE GENUS AND OF THE DIFFERENCE WHICH
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0016.flac,AND THE ABOVE PROPERTIES ARE FOUND IN THE ANGEL THEREFORE AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0018.flac,BUT HAS A FORM IN MATTER
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0020.flac,THEREFORE THE FORM OF AN ANGEL IS IN MATTER
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0021.flac,TO BE AS IMMATERIAL AS THEY ARE INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT SOME ASSERT THAT THE ANGELS ARE COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0032.flac,MATERIAL THINGS WHICH ARE BELOW OUR INTELLECT EXIST IN OUR INTELLECT IN A SIMPLER MODE THAN THEY EXIST IN THEMSELVES ANGELIC SUBSTANCES
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0037.flac,FOR MATTER RECEIVES THE FORM THAT THEREBY IT MAY BE CONSTITUTED IN SOME SPECIES EITHER OF AIR OR OF FIRE OR OF SOMETHING ELSE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0038.flac,HENCE SUCH A WAY OF RECEIVING IS NOT THAT OF MATTER BUT OF AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0043.flac,THAT AN ANGEL IS COMPOSED OF WHEREBY HE IS AND WHAT IS OR EXISTENCE AND WHAT IS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0044.flac,FOR WHAT IS IS THE FORM ITSELF SUBSISTING
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0048.flac,IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS THE LEAST POSSIBLE NUMBER IN THE ANGELIC NATURE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0049.flac,IN GREATER NUMBER THAN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0051.flac,SINCE INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0053.flac,MAY BE TERMINATED IN THEM AND HENCE THE SAME CONCLUSION IS TO BE DRAWN AS BEFORE ON THE CONTRARY
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0056.flac,IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES IS THE NUMBER
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0058.flac,EXIST IN EXCEEDING GREAT NUMBER FAR BEYOND ALL MATERIAL MULTITUDE THIS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0062.flac,IN THE ANGELS NUMBER IS NOT THAT OF DISCRETE QUANTITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVISION OF WHAT IS CONTINUOUS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0063.flac,HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE USE OF THIS ARGUMENT SINCE ONLY THROUGH SENSIBLE THINGS CAN WE COME TO KNOW
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0064.flac,NAMELY AS ONE IS SIMPLER THAN ANOTHER AND OF KEENER INTELLECT THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT DIFFER SPECIFICALLY
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0065.flac,THE MORE OUGHT IT TO BE MULTIPLIED BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE SO IF THERE WERE BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER ONE SPECIES
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0068.flac,BUT ARE DISTINGUISHED MATERIALLY IF THEREFORE THE ANGELS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0074.flac,TO THE DIVERSE DEGREES OF INTELLECTUAL NATURE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0076.flac,IS MORE PERFECT THAN AIR AND IN THIS WAY THE ANGELS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO MORE OR LESS REPLY
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0078.flac,TO BE THE ANGELS THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE CORRUPTIBLE BY THEIR NATURE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0085.flac,CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY WHEN THE FORM IS SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER BUT IF THE FORM SUBSISTS IN ITS OWN BEING AS HAPPENS
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0088.flac,BEING ABOVE TIME IS EVERLASTING HENCE EVERY INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE IS INCORRUPTIBLE OF ITS OWN NATURE
train-clean-360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0089.flac,DAMASCENE IS DEALING WITH PERFECT IMMORTALITY WHICH INCLUDES COMPLETE IMMUTABILITY SINCE EVERY CHANGE IS A KIND OF DEATH
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0000.flac,IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0001.flac,THAT IS IT BELONGS TO THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST AS A PROPERTY OF NATURE THAT HE IS UNDERSTOOD TO EXIST WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL SUBSTANCE AND WITHOUT
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0002.flac,NEEDS THE HELP OF ANY CORPOREAL ORGAN BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT EVERY CREATED SPIRIT NEEDS CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0003.flac,IS AKIN TO THAT OF AERIAL BODIES BUT THE NATURE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS IS THE SAME THEREFORE ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0004.flac,INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT THE ANGELS HAVE NOT BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM FOR WHATEVER BELONGS TO ANY NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0007.flac,NOT AS ASSERTING THE FACT BUT MERELY USING THE OPINION OF THE PLATONISTS WHO MAINTAINED THAT THERE ARE SOME AERIAL ANIMALS WHICH THEY TERMED DEMONS
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0008.flac,BECAUSE AN ANGEL HAS NO NEED FOR A BODY SINCE HIS OWN POWER EXCEEDS ALL BODILY POWER THEREFORE AN ANGEL DOES NOT ASSUME A BODY
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0009.flac,IT IS NOT SAID TO BE ASSUMED OTHERWISE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT ALL BODIES MOVED BY THE ANGELS ARE ASSUMED BY THEM THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0011.flac,THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0018.flac,WERE ORDAINED TO THAT ONE WHEREBY THE SON OF GOD APPEARED IN THE FLESH
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0022.flac,CONDENSING IT BY THE DIVINE POWER IN SO FAR
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0028.flac,THIS COULD NOT SO FITTINGLY BE DONE IF THEY WERE TO ASSUME TRUE MEN BECAUSE THE PROPERTIES OF SUCH MEN WOULD LEAD US TO MEN AND NOT TO ANGELS
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0031.flac,AND OTHER POWERS BY THE OTHER MEMBERS
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0033.flac,SINCE THEY ARE IN THEM AS MOVERS ARE IN THE MOVED AND THEY ARE HERE IN SUCH A WAY
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0034.flac,BUT RESOLVED INTO PRE EXISTING MATTER NEVERTHELESS CHRIST HAD A BODY OF SUCH A TRUE NATURE THAT FOOD COULD BE CHANGED INTO IT
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0036.flac,THIS IS WHAT THE ANGEL SAID TO TOBIAS WHEN I WAS WITH YOU I SEEMED INDEED TO EAT AND TO DRINK BUT I USE
train-clean-360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0037.flac,IN WHOM NEVERTHELESS HE WORSHIPPED GOD
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0004.flac,BANAL RED AND GOLD SUNSETS BUT HE MERELY GLANCED AT THEM AS HE STRAGGLED HOME AND REMARKED THAT THEY WERE NICE
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0018.flac,NATURALLY ABLE TO SIZE UP PEOPLE AND AFFAIRS SHE HAD COMMON SENSE AND UNKINDLED PASSION
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0036.flac,ALL RIGHT MINDED PERSONS AGREE THAT A GOOD NAME IS PRECIOUS BEYOND RUBIES BUT UNA WOULD HAVE PREFERRED LESS HONOR AND MORE RUBIES
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0068.flac,SOONER OR LATER ONE OF THE BOYS MIGHT PROPOSE BUT IN A SMALL TOWN IT WAS ALL A GAMBLE
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0077.flac,THE JOB BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE HUB STORE WAS THE ONLY ONE OFFERED HER IF I WERE ONLY A BOY SIGHED UNA
train-clean-360/3025/12971/3025-12971-0078.flac,I COULD GO TO WORK IN THE HARDWARE STORE OR ON THE RAILROAD OR ANYWHERE AND NOT LOSE RESPECTABILITY
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0000.flac,A SENSE OF DELICIOUS DREAMINESS OVERCAME ME MY MUSCLES RELAXED AND I WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING WAY TO MY DESIRE TO SLEEP WHEN THE SOUND OF APPROACHING HORSES REACHED MY EARS
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0020.flac,FACING MY UNKNOWN FOE AND THEN THE MOONLIGHT FLOODED THE CAVE
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0024.flac,MY BREATH WAS COMING IN QUICK SHORT GASPS COLD SWEAT STOOD OUT FROM EVERY PORE OF MY BODY AND THE ANCIENT EXPERIMENT OF PINCHING REVEALED THE FACT THAT I WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WRAITH
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0026.flac,AND AS MY HORSE HAD WANDERED OFF I WAS LEFT WITHOUT MEANS OF DEFENSE MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO LIE IN FLIGHT
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0029.flac,I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0030.flac,CONVINCED ME THAT THE NOISES I HAD HEARD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM PURELY NATURAL AND HARMLESS CAUSES
train-clean-360/303/123500/303-123500-0037.flac,I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0008.flac,THE OTHER VESSELS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE EACH ONE OPENING UPON US AS SHE SWUNG INTO POSITION OUR OWN FIRE NEVER DIMINISHED AND I DOUBT IF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR SHOTS WENT WILD
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0010.flac,TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0015.flac,THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0016.flac,INSTANTLY THE WARRIORS CEASED FIRING
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0019.flac,NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS MANIFEST UPON HER AS SHE DRIFTED SLOWLY WITH THE LIGHT BREEZE IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION SHE WAS DRIFTING SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0021.flac,AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
train-clean-360/303/123506/303-123506-0026.flac,AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
train-clean-360/303/123507/303-123507-0003.flac,FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
train-clean-360/303/123507/303-123507-0007.flac,THEY MAKE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE NEEDED A NEW LAW FOR EACH EMERGENCY THEY ARE UNFETTERED BY PRECEDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY AGES OF REPETITION
train-clean-360/303/123507/303-123507-0010.flac,I HAD OBSERVED ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER THAT THE PRISONER EXCHANGED WORDS WITH HER GUARDS AND THIS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY SPOKE
train-clean-360/303/123507/303-123507-0016.flac,I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0000.flac,LIFE AND WORK OF KEPLER KEPLER WAS BORN IN DECEMBER FIFTEEN SEVENTY ONE
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0005.flac,EQUANTS AND OTHER REMNANTS OF THE GREEK SYSTEM AND USHERED IN THE DAWN OF MODERN ASTRONOMY
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0023.flac,IF YOU INSCRIBE IN A CIRCLE A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES THEY ENVELOP ANOTHER CIRCLE
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0025.flac,AND THEN BRILLIANT IDEA HE REMEMBERS THAT THERE ARE BUT FIVE EUCLID HAD SHOWN
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0028.flac,AN OCTAHEDRON WHICH FIGURES HE TAKES TO INCLOSE THE SPHERES OF VENUS AND OF MERCURY RESPECTIVELY
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0035.flac,WHOM HE THOUGHT TO BE BEHAVING BADLY IN MONEY MATTERS TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY AND WROTE HIM A VIOLENT LETTER FULL OF REPROACHES AND INSULTS
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0052.flac,HENCE WAS INTRODUCED THE IDEA OF AN EQUANT
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0060.flac,AND AS RECORDED BY TYCHO
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0061.flac,OR ABOUT ONE EIGHTH OF A DEGREE
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0063.flac,HE WAS REWARDED BY FINDING THAT AT ANY RATE THE PLANE OF THE ORBIT DID NOT TILT UP AND DOWN IT WAS FIXED
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0071.flac,AND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OPTICAL INEQUALITY OF MARS
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0076.flac,HE HAD BEEN THERE ELEVEN YEARS BUT THEY HAD BEEN HARD YEARS OF POVERTY AND HE COULD LEAVE WITHOUT REGRET
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0079.flac,OF WHOSE FIERCE TEMPER SOMETHING HAS ALREADY BEEN INDICATED HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A LAW SUIT FOR SOME YEARS NEAR THEIR OLD HOME
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0086.flac,WHICH I NAMED BEFORE I WAS SURE OF MY DISCOVERY WHAT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I URGED AS A THING TO BE SOUGHT
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0095.flac,IT MATTERS LITTLE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER GERMANY HAVING ALMOST REFUSED HIM BREAD DURING HIS LIFE SHOULD
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0105.flac,TO SUPERNATURAL AGENCY WE HAVE HAD OUR COPERNICAN ERA NOT PERHAPS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL BUT STILL ACHIEVED
train-clean-360/3032/19361/3032-19361-0107.flac,AND OUR NUMEROUS METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES WITH THEIR CONTINUAL RECORD OF EVENTS
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0000.flac,THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE STORIES ABOUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM IT IS NOT THE STORY OF THE LAPWING WHO FOUND THE WATER
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0004.flac,SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS STRONG
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0014.flac,AND OF COURSE THE KING HAD TO MARRY EVER SO MANY MORE JUST TO SHOW
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0015.flac,BUT SOME WERE SIMPLY HORRID AND THE HORRID ONES QUARRELLED WITH THE NICE ONES AND MADE THEM HORRID TOO AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL QUARREL WITH SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD AND THAT WAS HORRID FOR HIM
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0017.flac,WHEN THEY QUARRELLED TOO MUCH HE ONLY WALKED BY HIMSELF IN ONE PART OF THE BEAUTIFUL PALACE GARDENS AND WISHED HE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0023.flac,BUT BALKIS HID AMONG THE TALL IRISES AND THE SPOTTED BAMBOOS AND THE RED LILLIES BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0025.flac,ALL SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S PALACE AND THIS GARDEN HERE WOULD IMMEDIATELY VANISH IN A CLAP OF THUNDER
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0027.flac,SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD BENT HIS HEAD AND WHISPERED VERY SOFTLY LITTLE MAN YOU KNOW THAT ALL YOUR STAMPING WOULDN'T BEND ONE BLADE OF GRASS
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0028.flac,YES I KNOW LITTLE BROTHER
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0029.flac,I SAID THAT TO QUIET HER AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0031.flac,WELL SAID THE BUTTERFLY FANNING HIMSELF MOST IMPORTANTLY BETWEEN YOU AND ME MY DEAR
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0034.flac,AND SHE HELD OUT HER FINGER AND WHISPERED SOFTLY TO THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE LITTLE WOMAN COME HERE
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0035.flac,LITTLE WOMAN DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOUR HUSBAND HAS JUST SAID
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0036.flac,AND SHE PICKED UP HER COURAGE WITH BOTH WINGS AND SAID O QUEEN BE LOVELY FOR EVER YOU KNOW WHAT MEN FOLK ARE LIKE
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0043.flac,WHEN HE STAMPS AGAIN YOU WILL BRING THEM BACK CAREFULLY NOW LITTLE BROTHER HE SAID
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0045.flac,THE DJINNS JERKED THE PALACE AND THE GARDENS A THOUSAND MILES INTO THE AIR
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0055.flac,AND WE ARE MOST EXTREMELY TROUBLED ON ACCOUNT OF THAT TROUBLE FOR IT WAS A TROUBLESOME TROUBLE UNLIKE ANY TROUBLE WE HAVE KNOWN
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0056.flac,SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S VERY BEST BELOVED
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0057.flac,AND THE RIVERS OF THE GOLD OF THE SOUTH FROM THE DESERT OF ZINN TO THE TOWERS OF ZIMBABWE
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0061.flac,THEY CAME DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS ONE HUNDRED ABREAST AND BENEATH HIS CAMPHOR TREE STILL WEAK WITH LAUGHING THEY SAW THE MOST WISE KING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
train-clean-360/3046/137739/3046-137739-0065.flac,THEN THEY PUT THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR HEADS AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY TIPTOED BACK TO THE PALACE MOST MOUSY QUIET

train-clean-360/3070/166420/3070-166420-0033.flac,BRIEFLY I TOLD HIM THEN A SILENCE FELL UPON US SUDDENLY
train-clean-360/3070/166420/3070-166420-0038.flac,A SOFT GREEN LIGHT PULSED THROUGH THE VALLEY UNDER IT
train-clean-360/3070/166420/3070-166420-0040.flac,FOR THE SIX BEAMS WERE SWAYING MOVING WITH EVER SWIFTER MOTION FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN EVER WIDENING SWEEP

train-clean-360/3070/166420/3070-166420-0048.flac,AND NOW THE BLACKNESS WAS LIKE AN EBON HAND BRANDISHING A THOUSAND JAVELINS OF TINSELED FLAME
train-clean-360/3070/166420/3070-166420-0054.flac,INTO THE RING'S MOUTH THE AURORA FLEW CASCADING IN A COLUMNED STREAM TO EARTH THEN SWIFTLY
train-clean-360/3070/166421/3070-166421-0001.flac,HE LAUGHED I'M FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY FREE
train-clean-360/3070/166421/3070-166421-0004.flac,THE SMILING SAPPHIRE FLOOR ROLLED EVER ON BEFORE US WHISPERING LITTLE PLAYFUL BREEZES FLEW DOWN THE SLOPES TO GOSSIP FOR A MOMENT WITH THE NODDING FLOWERS

train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0000.flac,MY DREAD OF AGAIN PASSING THROUGH THAT HAUNTED VALE I CERTAINLY DO
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0001.flac,DRAKE DON'T YOU AGREE SURE HE REPLIED SURE I'LL LOOK AFTER RUTH ER
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0010.flac,BEYOND WAS AN EXPANSE OF SMOOTH FLAGGING ALMOST CLEAR OF DEBRIS DRAKE GAVE A LOW WHISTLE I FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0011.flac,IN THE DUST COVERED FLOOR NOT MORE THAN A FOOT IN WIDTH
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0015.flac,AND STIFFENED THE FIRST TOUCH OF DREAD UPON ME FOR WITHIN THE RING
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0017.flac,I WEIGHED IT IN MY HAND IT WAS ODDLY HEAVY TWICE THE WEIGHT I SHOULD SAY OF PLATINUM

train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0033.flac,ROLLED THE SIX GLOBES AND AS THEY DROPPED TO THE FARTHER SIDE
train-clean-360/3070/166423/3070-166423-0034.flac,CURVED ITSELF LIKE A SCORPION'S TAIL DREW ITSELF INTO A CLOSER CIRCLED ARC AND DROPPED UPON THE FLOOR BEYOND AGAIN THE SIBILANT RUSTLING
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0001.flac,A CONTEMPT THAT IN MY CASE WAS ACCENTUATED BY THE FACT THAT I WORE SPECTACLES WHICH AT THAT DAY AND IN THAT REGION WERE USUALLY HELD TO INDICATE A DEFECTIVE MORAL CHARACTER IN THE WEARER
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0008.flac,AND BEGAN TO MOVE AROUND TO GET SOME FLOUR AND SALT PORK
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0011.flac,BY THIS TIME HE WAS QUITE SOBER AND REALLY DID NOT SEEM ANGRY LOOKING AT ME QUIZZICALLY HE TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD GIVE HIM BACK HIS RIFLE HE WOULD CALL IT QUITS AND WE COULD GO ON TOGETHER
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0022.flac,POLO IS A GOOD GAME INFINITELY BETTER FOR VIGOROUS MEN THAN TENNIS OR GOLF OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND THERE IS ALL THE FUN OF FOOTBALL WITH THE HORSE THROWN IN
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0027.flac,I DROPPED THE WRESTLING EARLIEST WHEN I BECAME GOVERNOR THE CHAMPION MIDDLEWEIGHT WRESTLER OF AMERICA HAPPENED TO BE IN ALBANY AND I GOT HIM TO COME ROUND THREE OR FOUR AFTERNOONS A WEEK
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0031.flac,AND IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT EYE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNABLE TO SHOOT ACCORDINGLY I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN AND WOULD HAVE TO STOP BOXING
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0034.flac,AND MERELY FOLLOWED BOXING AS THE AMUSEMENT OF HIS LIGHTER MOMENTS OR WHEN BUSINESS WAS SLACK
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0041.flac,AND AS GOVERNOR I AIDED IN THE PASSAGE OF AND SIGNED THE BILL PUTTING A STOP TO PROFESSIONAL BOXING FOR MONEY THIS WAS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PRIZE FIGHTERS THEMSELVES WERE CROOKED
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0043.flac,IT IS IDLE TO COMPARE THEM WITH BULL FIGHTING THE TORTURE AND DEATH OF THE WRETCHED HORSES IN BULL FIGHTING IS ENOUGH OF ITSELF TO BLAST THE SPORT NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE SKILL AND PROWESS SHOWN BY THE BULL FIGHTERS
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0044.flac,THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED IN A GLOVE FIGHT OR BARE FIST FIGHT TO STOP IT WHEN ONE COMPETITOR IS HOPELESSLY OUTCLASSED OR TOO BADLY HAMMERED BUT THE MEN WHO TAKE PART IN THESE FIGHTS ARE HARD AS NAILS
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0045.flac,AND IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO FEEL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THEIR RECEIVING PUNISHMENT WHICH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY DO NOT MIND OF COURSE THE MEN WHO LOOK ON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP WITH THE GLOVES OR WITHOUT THEM THEMSELVES
train-clean-360/3072/155948/3072-155948-0047.flac,MIKE IS A DEVOTED TEMPERANCE MAN AND CAN BE RELIED UPON FOR EVERY MOVEMENT IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0008.flac,THERE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH CLIMBING WHEN WE WALKED DOWN THE POTOMAC TO WASHINGTON FROM THE VIRGINIA END OF THE CHAIN BRIDGE I WOULD OCCASIONALLY TAKE SOME BIG GAME FRIEND FROM ABROAD SELOUS OR SAINT GEORGE LITTLEDALE
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0018.flac,AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN THUS EXPERIMENTALLY SHOWN UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS HOW EASY IT WAS TO DO IN ONE DAY THE TASK FOR WHICH THE ARMY OFFICERS WERE ALLOWED THREE DAYS ALL OPEN OBJECTION CEASED
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0019.flac,BUT SOME BUREAU CHIEFS STILL DID AS MUCH UNDERHANDED WORK AGAINST THE ORDER AS THEY DARED AND IT WAS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO REACH THEM
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0021.flac,THIS SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE BUT LEONARD ASSURES ME IT IS TRUE HE DID NOT INFORM ME AT THE TIME BEING AFRAID TO GET IN WRONG WITH HIS PERMANENT SUPERIORS
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0030.flac,BUT IT WAS EXCELLENT AS A MATTER OF INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING OF HANDLING FEET AND IN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS WE SOON MAY HAVE IN MEXICO SOUND HEARTS ARE NOT MUCH GOOD IF THE FEET WON'T STAND
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0032.flac,THE POINT IS THAT WHEREAS FORMERLY OFFICERS HAD TO PRACTICE WALKING A BIT AND GIVE SOME ATTENTION TO PROPER FOOTGEAR NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THEY DON'T DO IT
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0033.flac,THERE ARE PLENTY OF OFFICERS WHO DO NOT WALK ANY MORE THAN IS NECESSARY TO REACH A STREET CAR THAT WILL CARRY THEM FROM THEIR RESIDENCES TO THEIR OFFICES
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0035.flac,HE A CIVILIAN WAS WISE ENOUGH NOT TO TAKE THE ADVICE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TEST ESTABLISHED THAT WOULD OBLIGE OFFICERS TO TAKE SUFFICIENT EXERCISE TO PASS IT WITHOUT INCONVENIENCE

train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0040.flac,IN NO COUNTRY WITH AN ARMY WORTH CALLING SUCH IS THERE A CHANCE FOR A MAN PHYSICALLY UNFIT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0044.flac,WHOSE BROTHER AN OFFICER IN THE ITALIAN ARMY WHO HAD DIED ON DUTY IN A FOREIGN LAND HAD ALSO GREATLY LIKED THE ARTICLE AND CARRIED IT ROUND WITH HIM
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0045.flac,INSTEAD OF THE HEADING I ACTUALLY DID USE
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0052.flac,IS THAT WHICH COMES TO THE MAN WHO DIFFERS FROM HIS FELLOWS NOT BY THE KIND OF QUALITY WHICH HE POSSESSES BUT BY THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH HE HAS GIVEN THAT QUALITY
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0053.flac,IT IS THE ONLY KIND OF SUCCESS THAT IS OPEN TO MOST OF US YET SOME OF THE GREATEST SUCCESSES IN HISTORY HAVE BEEN THOSE OF THIS SECOND CLASS
train-clean-360/3072/155949/3072-155949-0057.flac,HE SAYS THAT AT THE OUTSET ALMOST EVERY MAN IS FRIGHTENED WHEN HE GOES INTO ACTION
train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0001.flac,AFTER HE HAD SERVED SOME YEARS ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR HE WENT TO BARBADOES WHERE HE MARRIED GOT INTO THE MERCHANT SERVICE AND DESIGNED TO SETTLE IN THE ISLAND

train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0005.flac,ONE OF THE CREW WHO HAD A FRIENDSHIP FOR WHITE KNEW THIS FELLOW'S DESIGN TO KILL HIM IN THE NIGHT AND THEREFORE ADVISED HIM TO LIE BETWEEN HIM AND THE SHIP'S SIDE WITH INTENTION TO SAVE HIM WHICH INDEED HE DID
train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0006.flac,AND SHAPED THEIR COURSE FOR MADAGASCAR WHERE BEING DRUNK AND MAD THEY KNOCKED THEIR SHIP ON THE HEAD AT THE SOUTH END OF THE ISLAND AT A PLACE CALLED BY THE NATIVES ELEXA THE COUNTRY THEREABOUTS WAS GOVERNED BY A KING
train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0008.flac,WHICH IS ABOUT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN LEAGUES FROM THE WRECK WHERE THEY LANDED AND WERE KINDLY RECEIVED BY THE KING OF BAVAW THE NAME OF THAT PART OF THE ISLAND WHO SPOKE GOOD ENGLISH

train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0011.flac,AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE ABOVE TERM A PIRATE BRIGANTINE CAME IN ON BOARD WHICH THE KING OBLIGED THEM TO ENTER OR TRAVEL BY LAND TO SOME OTHER PLACE
train-clean-360/3082/165428/3082-165428-0012.flac,THAT OF GOING ON BOARD THE PIRATE VESSEL WHICH WAS COMMANDED BY ONE WILLIAM READ WHO RECEIVED THEM VERY CIVILLY

train-clean-360/3094/136458/3094-136458-0110.flac,AND THIS DESIRE OF THEIRS IS ATTENDED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN DECLARES HE WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HIS LIFE TILL NOW
train-clean-360/3094/136458/3094-136458-0119.flac,AND SUCH IS THEIR CONDESCENSION THEIR INDULGENCE AND THEIR BENEFICENCE TO THOSE BELOW THEM THAT THERE IS NOT A NEIGHBOUR
train-clean-360/3105/163726/3105-163726-0004.flac,HE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN TO HAVE DONE HIS BEST BEING IN SIGHT OF HEARTH AND HOME

train-clean-360/3105/163726/3105-163726-0041.flac,NOW THESE TWO MAIDENS WERE KNOWN BECAUSE THEY HAD SERVED THE BEER AT AN ALE HOUSE AND MANY MEN WHO HAD LOOKED AT THEM OVER A PINT OR QUART VESSEL ESPECIALLY AS THEY WERE COMELY GIRLS

train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0000.flac,WHY THE HAND MAY BE DIPPED IN MOLTEN METALS
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0002.flac,THE FACT IS THAT THE WATER NEVER TOUCHES THE HOT IRON AT ALL PROVIDED THE HEAT IS SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE BUT ASSUMES A SLIGHTLY ELLIPTICAL SHAPE AND IS SUPPORTED BY A CUSHION OF VAPOR
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0004.flac,WATER DROPPED ON IT FROM A MEDICINE DROPPER WILL BOIL

train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0013.flac,THE WORKMEN AT THE SWEDISH MELTING HOUSE SHOWED THE SAME THING TO SOME TRAVELLERS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOR REGNARD SAW IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THE COPPER WORKS IN LAPLAND

train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0026.flac,THE METALLIC DRESS WHICH IS SUPERADDED TO THESE MEANS OF DEFENCE CONSISTS OF FIVE PRINCIPAL PIECES
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0030.flac,IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW THE HEAD EYES AND LUNGS ARE PROTECTED THE FIREMAN PUT ON THE ASBESTOS AND WIRE GAUZE CAP AND THE CUIRASS AND HELD THE SHIELD BEFORE HIS BREAST
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0034.flac,WHEN THIS COMBUSTIBLE MASS WAS SET ON FIRE
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0039.flac,AND PROUD OF HAVING SUCCEEDED IN BRAVING SO GREAT A DANGER IT IS A REMARKABLE RESULT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE FIREMEN ARE ABLE TO BREATHE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0040.flac,IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH ITS TEMPERATURE BECOMES SUPPORTABLE BUT ALSO TO THE SINGULAR POWER WHICH THE BODY POSSESSES OF RESISTING GREAT HEATS AND OF BREATHING AIR OF HIGH TEMPERATURES
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0041.flac,AND REMAINED TEN MINUTES BUT AS THE THERMOMETER SUNK VERY RAPIDLY THEY RESOLVED TO ENTER THE ROOM SINGLY
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0045.flac,THE SAME PERSON WHO EXPERIENCED NO INCONVENIENCE FROM AIR HEATED TO TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DEGREES COULD JUST BEAR RECTIFIED SPIRITS OF WINE AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES

train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0049.flac,AND REMAINED EIGHT MINUTES IN THIS SITUATION FREQUENTLY WALKING ABOUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM BUT STANDING STILL MOST OF THE TIME IN THE COOLEST SPOT
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0050.flac,THE AIR THOUGH VERY HOT GAVE NO PAIN AND SIR CHARLES AND ALL THE OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE OF OPINION THAT THEY COULD SUPPORT A MUCH GREATER HEAT
train-clean-360/3105/166683/3105-166683-0053.flac,THEY PLACED SOME EGGS AND A BEEF STEAK UPON A TIN FRAME NEAR THE THERMOMETER BUT MORE DISTANT FROM THE FURNACE THAN FROM THE WALL OF THE ROOM
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0012.flac,AND NOW I SAID
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0024.flac,AND IF HE FAILS THEN HE WILL USE FORCE AND PLUNDER THEM YES PROBABLY AND IF THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN WHAT THEN MY FRIEND

train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0032.flac,AS A TYRANT LEADS A STATE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY RECKLESS DEED BY WHICH HE CAN MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND THE RABBLE OF HIS ASSOCIATES
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0035.flac,WHAT SORT OF MISCHIEF FOR EXAMPLE
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0040.flac,OR IF THEY WANT ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY THEY IN THEIR TURN ARE EQUALLY READY TO BOW DOWN BEFORE THEM
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0046.flac,THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE I SAID AS TO WHICH IS WHICH AND THEREFORE I WILL AT ONCE ENQUIRE WHETHER YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT A SIMILAR DECISION ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE HAPPINESS AND MISERY
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0049.flac,THAT AGAIN HE SAID IS A VERY FAIR PROPOSAL
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0051.flac,THERE ARE FREEMEN AS WELL AS MASTERS IN SUCH A STATE YES HE SAID I SEE THAT THERE ARE A FEW
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0053.flac,INEVITABLY AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SOUL OF SUCH AN ONE IS THE SOUL OF A FREEMAN OR OF A SLAVE HE HAS THE SOUL OF A SLAVE IN MY OPINION
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0054.flac,AND THE STATE WHICH IS ENSLAVED UNDER A TYRANT IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF ACTING VOLUNTARILY UTTERLY INCAPABLE
train-clean-360/3114/170976/3114-170976-0059.flac,I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS AS YET REACHED THE UTMOST EXTREME OF MISERY THEN WHO IS MORE MISERABLE
train-clean-360/3114/170977/3114-170977-0003.flac,HE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO ON A JOURNEY OR TO SEE THE THINGS WHICH OTHER FREEMEN DESIRE TO SEE BUT HE LIVES IN HIS HOLE LIKE A WOMAN HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE
train-clean-360/3114/170977/3114-170977-0005.flac,HE HAS TO BE MASTER OF OTHERS WHEN HE IS NOT MASTER OF HIMSELF
train-clean-360/3114/170977/3114-170977-0007.flac,AND IS TRULY POOR IF YOU KNOW HOW TO INSPECT THE WHOLE SOUL OF HIM

train-clean-360/3114/170977/3114-170977-0025.flac,I SHOULD RATHER SAY EVEN HAD HE DESIRED COULD HARDLY HAVE TASTED THE SWEETNESS OF LEARNING AND KNOWING TRUTH
train-clean-360/3114/170977/3114-170977-0030.flac,REASON WITH WHOM AS WE WERE SAYING

train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0034.flac,THE MORE I AM CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL THE ONE THING THAT IS MOST WORTH LIVING FOR AND DYING FOR IF NEED BE IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME ONE ELSE MORE HAPPY AND MORE USEFUL
train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0038.flac,THIS MISSIONARY HAD A SON IN THE SCHOOL AND I NOTICED THAT WHATEVER THE MISSIONARY MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WITH REGARD TO OTHERS HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE HIS SON AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION
train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0046.flac,TO PASS NOT ONLY UPON THE EXHIBITS OF THE COLOURED SCHOOLS BUT ALSO UPON THOSE OF THE WHITE SCHOOLS I ACCEPTED THE POSITION AND SPENT A MONTH IN ATLANTA IN PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES WHICH IT ENTAILED

train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0055.flac,I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE NEGRO SHOULD CEASE VOTING FOR A MAN CANNOT LEARN THE EXERCISE OF SELF GOVERNMENT BY CEASING TO VOTE ANY MORE THAN A BOY CAN LEARN TO SWIM BY KEEPING OUT OF THE WATER BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IN HIS VOTING
train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0056.flac,HE SHOULD MORE AND MORE BE INFLUENCED BY THOSE OF INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER WHO ARE HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS I KNOW COLOURED MEN WHO THROUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT HELP AND ADVICE OF SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE

train-clean-360/3340/169293/3340-169293-0061.flac,THAN TO HAVE THAT POLITICAL STAGNATION WHICH ALWAYS RESULTS WHEN ONE HALF OF THE POPULATION HAS NO SHARE AND NO INTEREST IN THE GOVERNMENT

train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0000.flac,THERE WERE SHARP PAINS AND SUDDEN DIZZINESS AND THEN PROFUSE BLEEDING AT THE PORES WITH DISSOLUTION
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0007.flac,IT WAS A VOLUPTUOUS SCENE THAT MASQUERADE BUT FIRST LET ME TELL OF THE ROOMS IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THERE WERE SEVEN AN IMPERIAL SUITE
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0009.flac,THE APARTMENTS WERE SO IRREGULARLY DISPOSED THAT THE VISION EMBRACED BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME THERE WAS A SHARP TURN AT EVERY TWENTY OR THIRTY YARDS AND AT EACH TURN A NOVEL EFFECT
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0017.flac,BUT WHEN THE ECHOES HAD FULLY CEASED A LIGHT LAUGHTER AT ONCE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY THE MUSICIANS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED AS IF AT THEIR OWN NERVOUSNESS AND FOLLY AND MADE WHISPERING VOWS EACH TO THE OTHER
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0018.flac,BUT IN SPITE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS A GAY AND MAGNIFICENT REVEL THE TASTES OF THE DUKE WERE PECULIAR HE HAD A FINE EYE FOR COLORS AND EFFECTS

train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0027.flac,AND THEN THE MUSIC CEASED AS I HAVE TOLD
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0028.flac,BUT NOW THERE WERE TWELVE STROKES TO BE SOUNDED BY THE BELL OF THE CLOCK AND THUS IT HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT MORE OF THOUGHT CREPT WITH MORE OF TIME INTO THE MEDITATIONS OF THE THOUGHTFUL AMONG THOSE WHO REVELLED
train-clean-360/3521/7591/3521-7591-0031.flac,IN TRUTH THE MASQUERADE LICENSE OF THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY UNLIMITED BUT THE FIGURE IN QUESTION HAD OUT HERODED HEROD AND GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF EVEN THE PRINCE'S INDEFINITE DECORUM

train-clean-360/3537/5703/3537-5703-0013.flac,BECAUSE IT FALLS TO A LOWER PECUNIARY GRADE BUT THE FUNCTION OF DRESS AS AN EVIDENCE OF ABILITY TO PAY
train-clean-360/3537/5703/3537-5703-0036.flac,THE CHANGING STYLES ARE THE EXPRESSION OF A RESTLESS SEARCH FOR SOMETHING WHICH SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO OUR AESTHETIC SENSE

train-clean-360/362/123013/362-123013-0004.flac,YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
train-clean-360/362/123013/362-123013-0012.flac,OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
train-clean-360/362/123013/362-123013-0014.flac,THE WIND SEEMED TO HAVE LULLED OFF AFTER THAT FURIOUS BLAST WHICH TORE UP THE TREE IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER STILLER AND STILLER
train-clean-360/362/123013/362-123013-0017.flac,AND AS THE CURRENT WAS FLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT AND NO HELP AT HAND
train-clean-360/362/123013/362-123013-0020.flac,AND AS WE CAME UP MISTRESS RAN OUT SAYING ARE YOU REALLY SAFE MY DEAR OH I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS
train-clean-360/362/123047/362-123047-0007.flac,A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE

train-clean-360/362/123047/362-123047-0011.flac,HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
train-clean-360/362/123047/362-123047-0019.flac,BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
train-clean-360/362/123047/362-123047-0028.flac,HOWEVER I ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT INJURY TO MY SIGHT
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0001.flac,BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT FEELING IS BELIEVING
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0003.flac,WERE HARD ON THE HORSES IN THIS PLACE WE HAD NO SUNDAY REST
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0010.flac,AND NEVER HUNG BACK FOR AS POOR GINGER SAID IT WAS NO USE
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0012.flac,THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0014.flac,CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0015.flac,HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0018.flac,HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0027.flac,THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0028.flac,BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0030.flac,AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
train-clean-360/362/123048/362-123048-0034.flac,THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL

train-clean-360/362/123049/362-123049-0021.flac,GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
train-clean-360/362/123049/362-123049-0030.flac,WE MUST NOW BE LOOKING OUT FOR A QUIET GENTEEL PLACE FOR HIM
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0000.flac,APPENDIX C ACOUSTICS
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0001.flac,AND WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THAT RELATING TO THE RELATION BETWEEN VIBRATION RATES AND PITCHES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0004.flac,STRIKE A TUNING FORK AGAINST THE TOP OF A TABLE AND SEE THE VIBRATIONS WHICH CAUSE THE TONE OR IF THE FORK IS A SMALL ONE AND THE VIBRATIONS CANNOT BE SEEN HOLD IT AGAINST THE EDGE OF A SHEET OF PAPER AND HEAR THE BLOWS IT STRIKES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0005.flac,OR LOOK CLOSELY AT THE HEAVIER STRINGS OF THE VIOLIN OR BETTER STILL THE CELLO AND WATCH THEM OSCILLATE RAPIDLY TO AND FRO AS THE BOW MOVES ACROSS THEM
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0008.flac,THESE PARTICLES LIE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT NO MOVEMENT AT ALL CAN BE DETECTED AND IT IS ONLY WHEN THE DISTURBANCE FINALLY REACHES THE AIR PARTICLES THAT ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE EAR DRUM THAT ANY EFFECT IS EVIDENT
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0011.flac,A COMPLETE VIBRATION BACKWARD AND FORWARD CAUSES A SIMILAR BACKWARD AND FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PARTICLES OSCILLATION INSTEAD OF SIMPLY A FORWARD JERK AS IN THE CASE OF THE BILLIARD BALLS
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0015.flac,SOUND LIKE LIGHT MAY BE INTENSIFIED BY A SUITABLE REFLECTING SURFACE DIRECTLY BACK OF THE VIBRATING BODY
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0017.flac,IF THERE IS SUCH A SURFACE IN AN AUDITORIUM AS OFTEN OCCURS THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN POINT WHERE EVERYTHING CAN BE HEARD VERY EASILY
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0018.flac,ECHOES ARE CAUSED BY SOUND REFLECTION THE DISTANCE OF THE REFLECTING SURFACE FROM THE VIBRATING BODY DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SYLLABLES THAT WILL BE ECHOED THE ACOUSTICS OF AN AUDITORIUM
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0019.flac,DEPEND UPON THE POSITION AND NATURE OF THE REFLECTING SURFACES AND ALSO UPON THE LENGTH OF TIME A SOUND PERSISTS AFTER THE VIBRATING BODY HAS STOPPED
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0021.flac,THE DURATION OF THE REVERBERATION DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE AND HEIGHT OF THE ROOM MATERIAL OF FLOOR AND WALLS FURNITURE SIZE OF AUDIENCE ET CETERA SIX
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0023.flac,BUT IF I TAP THE HEAD OF A KETTLE DRUM A REGULAR SERIES OF VIBRATIONS IS SET UP AND THE RESULTING SOUND IS REFERRED TO AS TONE IN GENERAL THE MATERIAL OF MUSIC CONSISTS OF TONES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0024.flac,SEVEN
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0026.flac,BUT IF IT VIBRATES REGULARLY AT THE RATE OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PER SECOND A TONE OF VERY LOW PITCH IS HEARD IF IT VIBRATES AT THE RATE OF TWENTY FOUR THE PITCH IS HIGHER
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0027.flac,AT THIRTY HIGHER STILL AT TWO HUNDRED YET HIGHER AND WHEN A RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND PER SECOND HAS BEEN REACHED THE PITCH IS SO HIGH THAT MOST EARS CANNOT PERCEIVE IT AT ALL
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0028.flac,THE HIGHEST TONE THAT CAN ORDINARILY BE HEARD IS THE E FLAT FOUR OCTAVES HIGHER THAN THE HIGHEST E FLAT OF THE PIANO THE ENTIRE RANGE OF SOUND HUMANLY AUDIBLE IS THEREFORE ABOUT ELEVEN OCTAVES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0029.flac,BUT ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF THESE OCTAVES ARE UTILIZED FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0032.flac,IN THE SAME WAY IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT IF THE RATE IS MULTIPLIED BY FIVE QUARTERS THE PITCH OF THE TONE WILL BE A MAJOR THIRD HIGHER
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0038.flac,THE OTHER WILL SOON BEGIN TO VIBRATE ALSO AND THE COMBINED TONE WILL BE LOUDER THAN IF ONLY ONE STRING PRODUCED IT
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0039.flac,TEN QUALITY DEPENDS UPON THE SHAPE OR FORM OF THE VIBRATIONS WHICH GIVE RISE TO THE TONE A SERIES OF SIMPLE VIBRATIONS WILL CAUSE A SIMPLE OR COLORLESS TONE
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0040.flac,CAUSE MORE INDIVIDUALISTIC PECULIARITIES OF QUALITY QUALITY IS AFFECTED ALSO BY THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE RESONANCE BODY
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0041.flac,ELEVEN PRACTICALLY EVERY MUSICAL TONE REALLY CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL TONES SOUNDING SIMULTANEOUSLY
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0044.flac,DOES NOT MERELY VIBRATE IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT HAS IN ADDITION TO THE PRINCIPAL OSCILLATION A NUMBER OF SECTIONAL MOVEMENTS ALSO
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0046.flac,THUS E G A TONE THAT HAS TOO LARGE A PROPORTION OF THE FOURTH UPPER PARTIAL
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0049.flac,SUCH A TONE IS SAID TO BE COMPLEX TWELVE
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0051.flac,THERE WOULD BE MANY OTHER DISADVANTAGES IN SUCH A SYSTEM NOTABLY THE INABILITY TO MODULATE FREELY TO OTHER KEYS
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0053.flac,EQUAL TEMPERAMENT MEANS SIMPLY DIVIDING THE OCTAVE INTO TWELVE EQUAL PARTS THUS CAUSING ALL SCALES AS PLAYED ON KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS AT LEAST TO SOUND EXACTLY ALIKE
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0056.flac,THIS PITCH IS NOT IN ACTUAL USE FOR MUSICAL PURPOSES BUT IS RETAINED FOR THEORETICAL PURPOSES BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENIENCE OF COMPUTATION BEING A POWER OF TWO
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0058.flac,CONCERT PITCH IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN INTERNATIONAL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO VARYING SOMEWHAT BUT BEING ALMOST ALWAYS LESS THAN ONE HALF STEP
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0059.flac,THIS HIGHER PITCH IS STILL OFTEN USED BY BANDS AND SOMETIMES BY ORCHESTRAS TO GIVE GREATER BRILLIANCY TO THE WIND INSTRUMENTS REFERENCES
train-clean-360/3630/11612/3630-11612-0060.flac,BROADHOUSE THE STUDENT'S HELMHOLZ HELMHOLTZ SENSATIONS OF TONE HAMILTON SOUND AND ITS RELATION TO MUSIC
train-clean-360/3630/24758/3630-24758-0000.flac,AND THE BODY IS AFFECTED IN THE SAME MANNER WHEREFORE IN SO FAR AS THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE THING IS STRONG A MAN IS DETERMINED TO REGARD IT WITH PAIN
train-clean-360/3630/24758/3630-24758-0005.flac,THIS RENDERS THEM SECURE AFRESH THEREFORE THEY REJOICE AFRESH
train-clean-360/3630/24758/3630-24758-0006.flac,MUST OTHER CONDITIONS BEING SIMILAR BE GREATER THAN IF IT WERE FELT TOWARDS A THING ACTING BY NECESSITY
train-clean-360/3630/24758/3630-24758-0007.flac,MOREOVER WE ARE APT TO ESTIMATE SUCH OBJECTS ABOVE OR BELOW THEIR TRUE VALUE
train-clean-360/3630/24758/3630-24758-0009.flac,FURTHER IN SO FAR AS WE HOPE FOR OR FEAR ANYTHING WE REGARD IT WITH LOVE OR HATRED
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0001.flac,BUT THERE WAS THE USUAL BUSTLE GOING ON IN THE OTHER ROOMS OF THE TAVERN THERE WERE SHOUTS FOR THE WAITERS THE SOUND OF POPPING CORKS THE CLICK OF BILLIARD BALLS THE DRONE OF THE ORGAN
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0003.flac,HE HAD FINISHED DINNER AND WAS DRINKING TEA LET ME HAVE SOUP

train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0029.flac,BUT HE BEGGED ME NOT TO TELL DMITRI THAT HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT HIM ADDED ALYOSHA
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0030.flac,ARE YOU FROWNING ON SMERDYAKOV'S ACCOUNT ASKED ALYOSHA YES ON HIS ACCOUNT
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0031.flac,BUT THEN HE SUDDENLY SMILED BITTERLY CAIN'S ANSWER ABOUT HIS MURDERED BROTHER WASN'T IT
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0034.flac,YOU KNOW ON THE CONTRARY THAT DMITRI BEHAVED AS THOUGH THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0036.flac,I COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED EVEN YESTERDAY HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO PUT AN END TO IT IF I WANTED
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0044.flac,I SHOULD HAVE LEFT LONG AGO SO FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED BUT WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT MY GOING AWAY WE'VE PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE I GO AN ETERNITY
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0045.flac,IS THAT IT NO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT FOR IT'S DIFFERENT FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT WE IN OUR GREEN YOUTH HAVE TO SETTLE THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0046.flac,WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE OR DON'T YOU BELIEVE AT ALL THAT'S WHAT YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN MEANING FOR THESE THREE MONTHS HAVEN'T THEY PERHAPS SO SMILED ALYOSHA
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0053.flac,BUT THERE'S ONE RUSSIAN BOY CALLED ALYOSHA I AM AWFULLY FOND OF HOW NICELY YOU PUT THAT IN ALYOSHA LAUGHED SUDDENLY
train-clean-360/3638/696/3638-696-0055.flac,BUT NOW I'VE NO OBJECTION TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU AND I SAY SO VERY SERIOUSLY

train-clean-360/3638/758/3638-758-0011.flac,THERE WAS SOMETHING CRAZY ABOUT HIS GESTURES AND THE WORDS THAT BROKE FROM HIM OLD MAN DEAR OLD MAN HE EXCLAIMED EVERY MINUTE GAZING AT ILUSHA

train-clean-360/3645/186230/3645-186230-0025.flac,NOR AS AMUSING AS PATRICIA SO AUNT JANE PAYS LITTLE ATTENTION TO ME SHE'S A DREADFUL OLD WOMAN AND I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO APPEAR TO LIKE HER THAT PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR MY FAILURE
train-clean-360/3645/186230/3645-186230-0036.flac,AND WAS SO GENTLE AND UNOBSTRUSIVE THAT AUNT JANE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
train-clean-360/3645/39840/3645-39840-0004.flac,HIS DISAPPROVAL WAS SOFTENED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE INEVITABILITY OF MISTAKES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF REFORM IN EVERY DEPARTMENT
train-clean-360/3645/39840/3645-39840-0006.flac,COMING IMMEDIATELY SAID THE CLERK AND TWO MINUTES LATER THERE DID ACTUALLY APPEAR IN THE DOORWAY THE LARGE FIGURE OF AN OLD SOLICITOR WHO HAD BEEN CONSULTING WITH THE LAWYER HIMSELF
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0012.flac,HE HAD SAID A LITTLE PRAYER FOR EVERYBODY AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP THERE ON THE FLOWER DECKED BALCONY WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ROOM AND THE CANDLES WERE BEING LIT
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0018.flac,ANNA PALUDA TURNED AT THE SOUND OF THE WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL

train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0022.flac,HAD EDWARD BEEN FACING ANNA AS HE SPOKE HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED A CURIOUS LIGHT CREEP INTO THE BLACK EYES AS THOUGH SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED SUDDENLY TO HER
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0028.flac,THE LID WAS BROKEN HERE AND THERE AND HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PASTED TOGETHER WITH SCRAPS OF PLASTER PAPER
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0033.flac,DASSO LEFT THE GARE SAINT LAZARE THE NEXT MORNING
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0034.flac,AND SO ACROSS THE CHANNEL DUPINE BEING NOW KNOWN BY SIGHT TO DASSO WISELY REFRAINED FROM FOLLOWING HIM ON TO THE BOAT
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0035.flac,BUT WIRED COMPREHENSIVELY TO A CONFRERE IN BRIGHTON TO MOTOR OVER TO NEWHAVEN AND TAKE UP THE CHASE I HAVE HEARD ONLY THIS MORNING THAT THIS GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
train-clean-360/3645/77173/3645-77173-0037.flac,SHE THOUGHT OF EDWARD AS SHE FOLDED THE LETTER AND PUT IT AWAY
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0001.flac,AND AS HE THOUGHT IT FIT FOR HIM WHO BARE THE BURDEN OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE TO DESPISE SUCH MISFORTUNES
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0002.flac,NOW IT WAS IN SO GREAT A COMMOTION AND WHO MIGHT BE BEST ABLE TO PUNISH THE JEWS FOR THEIR REBELLION AND MIGHT PREVENT THE SAME DISTEMPER FROM SEIZING UPON THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS ALSO
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0003.flac,SEEING HE WAS GROWING AN OLD MAN ALREADY IN THE CAMP AND FROM HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN EXERCISED IN WARLIKE EXPLOITS
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0004.flac,AND THAT HE HAD HIS SONS AS HOSTAGES FOR HIS FIDELITY TO HIMSELF
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0006.flac,BUT THIS NOT WITHOUT GREAT ENCOMIUMS AND FLATTERING COMPELLATIONS SUCH AS NECESSITY REQUIRED AND SUCH AS MIGHT MOLLIFY HIM INTO COMPLAISANCE
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0015.flac,AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT THEM BACK AFTER THEIR FLIGHT AND DRIVEN THEM TOGETHER THEY RAN THEM THROUGH AND SLEW A VAST NUMBER OF THEM
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0016.flac,INSOMUCH THAT OTHERS ENCOMPASSED OTHERS OF THEM AND DROVE THEM BEFORE THEM WHITHERSOEVER THEY TURNED THEMSELVES AND SLEW THEM EASILY WITH THEIR ARROWS
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0017.flac,TILL TEN THOUSAND MEN OF THE JEWS SIDE LAY DEAD WITH TWO OF THEIR GENERALS JOHN AND SILAS AND THE GREATER PART OF THE REMAINDER WERE WOUNDED WITH NIGER THEIR REMAINING GENERAL
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0018.flac,CALLED SALLIS SOME FEW ALSO OF THE ROMANS
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0019.flac,BUT THE LOSSES THEY HAD SUSTAINED RATHER QUICKENED THEIR RESOLUTION FOR OTHER ATTEMPTS
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0020.flac,SO WHEN THEY HAD LAIN STILL SO LITTLE A WHILE THAT THEIR WOUNDS WERE NOT YET THOROUGHLY CURED THEY GOT TOGETHER ALL THEIR FORCES
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0022.flac,HOWEVER THEY WERE DRIVEN ALONG TOGETHER BY THE ENEMY WHO PRESSED HARD UPON THEM INTO A CERTAIN STRONG TOWER BELONGING TO A VILLAGE CALLED BEZEDEH
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0028.flac,SEEING IT WAS THE LARGEST CITY OF GALILEE AND BUILT IN A PLACE BY NATURE VERY STRONG AND MIGHT BE A SECURITY OF THE WHOLE NATION'S FIDELITY TO THE ROMANS
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0030.flac,ITS LENGTH IS ALSO FROM MELOTH TO THELLA

train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0038.flac,THEY ARE NOT NATURALLY WATERED BY MANY RIVERS BUT DERIVE THEIR CHIEF MOISTURE FROM RAIN WATER OF WHICH THEY HAVE NO WANT AND FOR THOSE RIVERS WHICH THEY HAVE
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0039.flac,THAN DO THOSE IN OTHER PLACES AND WHAT IS THE GREATEST SIGN OF EXCELLENCY AND OF ABUNDANCE
train-clean-360/3654/171137/3654-171137-0045.flac,AND REACHES BREADTHWAYS TO THE LAKE OF TIBERIAS AND IN LENGTH IS EXTENDED FROM A VILLAGE CALLED ARPHA AS FAR AS JULIAS

train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0001.flac,AND SIX THOUSAND FOOTMEN UNDER PLACIDUS THE TRIBUNE
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0002.flac,THE FOOT WERE PUT INTO THE CITY TO BE A GUARD TO IT BUT THE HORSE LODGED ABROAD IN THE CAMP
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0006.flac,WHICH WERE THE MOST EMINENT LEGIONS OF ALL HE JOINED THEM TO THAT FIFTEENTH LEGION WHICH WAS WITH HIS FATHER EIGHTEEN COHORTS FOLLOWED THESE LEGIONS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0009.flac,MALCHUS ALSO THE KING OF ARABIA SENT A THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES FIVE THOUSAND FOOTMEN THE GREATEST PART OF WHICH WERE ARCHERS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0010.flac,WHEN ALL WERE UNITED TOGETHER AMOUNTED TO SIXTY THOUSAND BESIDES THE SERVANTS WHO AS THEY FOLLOWED IN VAST NUMBERS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0012.flac,ONLY THEY WERE SUBJECT TO THEIR MASTERS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0013.flac,IN PROVIDING THEMSELVES OF SUCH HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS AS MIGHT NOT ONLY SERVE AT OTHER TIMES FOR THE COMMON OFFICES OF LIFE BUT MIGHT ALSO BE OF ADVANTAGE TO THEM IN THEIR WARS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0015.flac,NOR CAN FEAR AFFRIGHT THEM OUT OF IT NOR CAN LABOR TIRE THEM WHICH FIRMNESS OF CONDUCT MAKES THEM ALWAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE THAT HAVE NOT THE SAME FIRMNESS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0017.flac,NOR IS THE FENCE THEY RAISE RASHLY MADE OR UNEVEN
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0018.flac,NOR DO THOSE THAT ARE IN IT TAKE THEIR PLACES AT RANDOM BUT IF IT HAPPENS THAT THE GROUND IS UNEVEN IT IS FIRST LEVELED THEIR CAMP IS ALSO FOUR SQUARE BY MEASURE
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0023.flac,TO BE BY THEM CARRIED TO ALL THAT ARE UNDER THEIR COMMAND WHICH IS ALSO OBSERVED WHEN THEY GO TO FIGHT
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0025.flac,THEN DO THE TRUMPETS GIVE A SOUND THE THIRD TIME THAT THEY ARE TO GO OUT IN ORDER TO EXCITE THOSE THAT ON ANY ACCOUNT ARE A LITTLE TARDY
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0030.flac,BUT WHEN THEY ARE TO FIGHT THEY LEAVE NOTHING WITHOUT FORECAST NOR TO BE DONE OFF HAND
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0031.flac,FOR WHICH REASON THEY SELDOM COMMIT ANY ERRORS AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AT ANY TIME THEY EASILY CORRECT THOSE MISTAKES
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0037.flac,NOR CAN WE FIND ANY EXAMPLES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN CONQUERED IN BATTLE WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT EITHER BY THE MULTITUDE OF THE ENEMIES
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0038.flac,OR BY THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE PLACES THEY WERE IN NO NOR BY FORTUNE NEITHER FOR THEIR VICTORIES HAVE BEEN SURER TO THEM THAN FORTUNE COULD HAVE GRANTED THEM
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0045.flac,BE CAUSE THE STROKES ONLY TOUCHED THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODIES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH THEIR ARMOR IN ALL PARTS
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0050.flac,THEN CAME THE ENSIGNS ENCOMPASSING THE EAGLE WHICH IS AT THE HEAD OF EVERY ROMAN LEGION
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0053.flac,WHICH WAS BORNE BY THE MULES AND OTHER BEASTS OF BURDEN
train-clean-360/3654/171138/3654-171138-0054.flac,HE ALSO SHOWED HIS ARMY TO THE ENEMY IN ORDER TO AFFRIGHT THEM AND TO AFFORD THEM A SEASON FOR REPENTANCE
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0006.flac,GOT UPON AN ACCLIVITY WHENCE THE CITY MIGHT EASILY BE TAKEN JOSEPHUS WAS THEN IN FEAR FOR THE CITY AND LEAPED OUT AND ALL THE JEWISH MULTITUDE WITH HIM
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0007.flac,THESE FELL TOGETHER UPON THE ROMANS IN GREAT NUMBERS AND DROVE THEM AWAY FROM THE WALL AND PERFORMED A GREAT MANY GLORIOUS AND BOLD ACTIONS YET DID THEY SUFFER AS MUCH AS THEY MADE THE ENEMY SUFFER
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0009.flac,AND WHEN THE FIGHT HAD LASTED ALL DAY IT WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE COMING ON OF THE NIGHT
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0012.flac,THAT ITS TOP MIGHT NOT BE CAPABLE OF BEING SEIZED UPON BY THE ENEMIES
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0014.flac,AND WHEN THE RESOLUTION WAS THERE TAKEN TO RAISE A BANK AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL WHICH WAS PRACTICABLE HE SENT HIS WHOLE ARMY ABROAD TO GET THE MATERIALS TOGETHER
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0018.flac,AT THE SAME TIME SUCH ENGINES AS WERE INTENDED FOR THAT PURPOSE THREW AT ONCE LANCES UPON THEM WITH A GREAT NOISE
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0021.flac,THESE CAST AWAY THE EARTH THAT COMPOSED THE BANK AND BURNT THE WOODEN PARTS OF IT TOGETHER WITH THE HURDLES
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0023.flac,AND BROUGHT NEARER THAN EVER TO THE BATTLEMENTS THAT BELONGED TO THE WALLS JOSEPHUS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY WRONG IN HIM IF HE COULD MAKE NO CONTRIVANCES IN OPPOSITION TO THEIRS
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0024.flac,HE INVENTED THIS SORT OF COVER FOR THEM
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0025.flac,AND THE FIRE THAT WAS THROWN WOULD BE QUENCHED BY THE MOISTURE THAT WAS IN THEM AND THESE HE SET BEFORE THE WORKMEN AND UNDER THEM THESE WORKMEN WENT ON WITH THEIR WORKS IN SAFETY
train-clean-360/3654/171139/3654-171139-0026.flac,HE ALSO BUILT A GOOD NUMBER OF TOWERS UPON THE WALL AND FITTED IT TO STRONG BATTLEMENTS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0000.flac,THE CALAMITIES AND SLAUGHTERS THAT CAME UPON THE JEWS ONE
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0002.flac,FOR FLORUS CAUGHT SUCH AS RAN AWAY AND SENT THEM IN BONDS TO THE GALLEYS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0004.flac,AND FALLING UPON GAULONITIS SOME CITIES THEY DESTROYED THERE AND SOME THEY SET ON FIRE AND THEN WENT TO KEDASA BELONGING TO THE TYRIANS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0006.flac,BUT TO PREVENT THE DANGER UNDER WHICH THEY WERE FROM THEM SO THAT THE DISORDERS IN ALL SYRIA WERE TERRIBLE AND EVERY CITY WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO ARMIES
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0010.flac,IT WAS THEN COMMON TO SEE CITIES FILLED WITH DEAD BODIES STILL LYING UNBURIED AND THOSE OF OLD MEN MIXED WITH INFANTS ALL DEAD AND SCATTERED ABOUT TOGETHER
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0011.flac,YOU MIGHT THEN SEE THE WHOLE PROVINCE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE CALAMITIES WHILE THE DREAD OF STILL MORE BARBAROUS PRACTICES WHICH WERE THREATENED
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0012.flac,THREE AND THUS FAR THE CONFLICT HAD BEEN BETWEEN JEWS AND FOREIGNERS BUT WHEN THEY MADE EXCURSIONS TO SCYTHOPOLIS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0017.flac,SOME AS THEY LAY UNGUARDED AND SOME AS THEY LAY ASLEEP THE NUMBER THAT WAS SLAIN WAS ABOVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0019.flac,ALTHOUGH HE ABUSED THEM BOTH TO THE MISCHIEVING OF HIS COUNTRYMEN
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0029.flac,AND THOSE OF PTOLEMAIS TWO THOUSAND AND PUT NOT A FEW INTO BONDS THOSE OF TYRE ALSO PUT A GREAT NUMBER TO DEATH BUT KEPT A GREATER NUMBER IN PRISON
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0030.flac,AND APAMIANS SPARED THOSE THAT DWELT WITH THEM AND WOULD NOT ENDURE EITHER TO KILL ANY OF THE JEWS OR TO PUT THEM IN BONDS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0032.flac,TO ANTIOCH BUT HAD LEFT ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WHOSE NAME WAS NOARUS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS WHICH NOARUS WAS OF KIN TO KING SOHEMUS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0050.flac,WHICH HOUSES WERE FIRST PLUNDERED OF WHAT WAS IN THEM AND THEN SET ON FIRE BY THE ROMANS WHEREIN NO MERCY WAS SHOWN TO THE INFANTS AND NO REGARD HAD TO THE AGED
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0055.flac,BESIDES THOSE AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE SENT BY THE KINGS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0057.flac,AND THUS DID HE MARCH TO PTOLEMAIS
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0059.flac,AND A DIRECTOR WHAT WAS FIT TO BE DONE
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0063.flac,AND FELL UPON THOSE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND UNEXPECTEDLY AND DESTROYED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND OF THEM
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0064.flac,AND GAVE ORDER THAT IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT CITY BY SURPRISE THEY SHOULD KEEP IT BUT THAT IN CASE THE CITIZENS SHOULD PERCEIVE THEY WERE COMING TO ATTACK THEM
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0067.flac,TO THE TOPARCHY OF NARBATENE
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0068.flac,WHO DESTROYED THE COUNTRY AND SLEW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF ITS PEOPLE
train-clean-360/3686/171133/3686-171133-0073.flac,AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHILE THE REST
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0001.flac,ONE AND NOW GALLUS SEEING NOTHING MORE THAT LOOKED TOWARDS AN INNOVATION IN GALILEE
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0002.flac,SO THEY CAME AND FINDING THEIR CAMP DESERTED THEY BURNT IT AS WELL AS THE VILLAGES THAT LAY ABOUT IT
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0003.flac,HE FOUND THE CITY EMPTY OF ITS MEN
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0004.flac,AND SO MARCHED FORWARDS AND ASCENDING BY BETBORON
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0008.flac,AS WERE NOT YET TIRED IN THE ACTION HAD WHEELED ROUND AND SUCCORED THAT PART OF THE ARMY WHICH WAS NOT YET BROKEN
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0015.flac,TO SECURE THEM OF THE ROMANS ENTIRE FORGIVENESS OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE AMISS
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0018.flac,WHICH WAS DISTANT SEVEN FURLONGS FROM THE CITY
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0019.flac,OUT OF EXPECTATION THAT THOSE WITHIN MIGHT PERHAPS YIELD A LITTLE
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0020.flac,TO SEIZE UPON THEIR CORN AND ON THE FOURTH DAY
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0022.flac,HE SET THE PART CALLED BEZETHA
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0024.flac,HE HAD WON THE CITY PRESENTLY AND THE WAR HAD BEEN PUT AN END TO AT ONCE
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0025.flac,AND A GREAT NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HORSE HAD BEEN CORRUPTED BY FLORUS
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0026.flac,AND THAT WAS THE OCCASION THAT THIS WAR LASTED SO VERY LONG AND THEREBY THE JEWS WERE INVOLVED IN SUCH INCURABLE CALAMITIES FIVE
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0027.flac,AND WERE ABOUT TO OPEN THE GATES FOR HIM BUT HE OVERLOOKED THIS OFFER PARTLY OUT OF HIS ANGER AT THE JEWS AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE THEY WERE IN EARNEST
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0036.flac,AND DESTROYED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF BOTH THEIR HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0046.flac,THAT AT ONCE REJOICED AND WERE IN A RAGE INDEED THINGS WERE COME TO SUCH A PASS
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0050.flac,AND THEN PURSUED AFTER CESTIUS BUT HE HAD ALREADY MADE USE OF A GREAT PART OF THE NIGHT IN HIS FLIGHT AND STILL MARCHED QUICKER WHEN IT WAS DAY
train-clean-360/3686/171134/3686-171134-0053.flac,BUT HAD SLAIN OF THE ROMANS FIVE THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED FOOTMEN AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HORSEMEN

train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0014.flac,DELIGHTFUL POWER OF MAGIC I THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF HUMAN SUFFERING I HAVE NOT ONLY RELIEVED BUT ACTUALLY ANNIHILATED AND IN A GLOW OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0015.flac,I STOOD WATCHING THE UNLOADING OF THE CART STILL HOLDING THE MAGIC WATCH OPEN IN MY HAND AS I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE AGAIN REACHED THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH I HAD PUT BACK THE HAND
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0018.flac,AND TOOK THE SEAWARD ROAD THAT LED TO MY LODGINGS THE GOOD I FANCIED I COULD DO IS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM THE EVIL OF THIS TROUBLESOME WORLD IS THE ONLY ABIDING REALITY
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0020.flac,I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT I FREELY CONFESS IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THEN WHY SHOULD I EXPECT IT OF MY READER WHO QUITE POSSIBLY HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0045.flac,THE EARL WAS SITTING ALONE WHEN WE ENTERED I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME IN TO KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID MURIEL IS GONE TO BED THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER

train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0051.flac,AND LET ME WISH YOU JOY ALSO DEAR FRIEND HE ADDED LOOKING SADLY AT THE EARL AND SPEAKING IN THE SAME HOLLOW TONES THAT HAD STARTLED US SO MUCH THANK YOU THE OLD MAN SAID SIMPLY AND HEARTILY
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0055.flac,BUT I HOPE TO RUN DOWN AGAIN IN A MONTH I ADDED I WOULD STAY NOW IF I COULD I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO BE ALONE
train-clean-360/3825/134160/3825-134160-0056.flac,I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT A POST IN INDIA THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED ME
train-clean-360/3835/178028/3835-178028-0005.flac,IT WAS LIKE A SUCCESSFULLY ARRANGED SURPRISE MENTION WAS MADE IN KUTUZOV'S REPORT OF THE RUSSIAN LOSSES
train-clean-360/3835/178028/3835-178028-0010.flac,A TERRIBLE PIECE OF NEWS WAS ADDED
train-clean-360/3835/178028/3835-178028-0011.flac,HAD SUDDENLY DIED OF THAT TERRIBLE MALADY IT HAD BEEN SO AGREEABLE TO MENTION OFFICIALLY AT LARGE GATHERINGS
train-clean-360/3835/178028/3835-178028-0019.flac,I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM YOU YET ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER I RECEIVED FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF MOSCOW
train-clean-360/3835/178028/3835-178028-0020.flac,THE SAD NEWS THAT YOU WITH THE ARMY HAVE DECIDED TO ABANDON MOSCOW
train-clean-360/3835/178029/3835-178029-0000.flac,NINE DAYS AFTER THE ABANDONMENT OF MOSCOW A MESSENGER FROM KUTUZOV REACHED PETERSBURG
train-clean-360/3835/178029/3835-178029-0003.flac,AND THAT AS THE ONLY REMAINING CHOICE WAS BETWEEN LOSING THE ARMY AS WELL AS MOSCOW OR LOSING MOSCOW ALONE
train-clean-360/3835/178029/3835-178029-0007.flac,HOW DID YOU LEAVE THE ARMY WHEN IT SAW MY ANCIENT CAPITAL ABANDONED WITHOUT A BATTLE DID YOU NOT NOTICE DISCOURAGEMENT SEEING THAT HIS MOST GRACIOUS RULER WAS CALM ONCE MORE
train-clean-360/3835/178029/3835-178029-0018.flac,WAS FLUSHED AND HIS EYES GLEAMED WITH RESOLUTION AND ANGER COLONEL MICHAUD
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0001.flac,ALL RUSSIANS FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST WERE SOLELY ENGAGED IN SACRIFICING THEMSELVES
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0003.flac,IT APPEARS SO TO US BECAUSE WE SEE ONLY THE GENERAL HISTORIC INTEREST OF THAT TIME AND DO NOT SEE ALL THE PERSONAL HUMAN INTERESTS THAT PEOPLE HAD
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0010.flac,THE MORE CLOSELY A MAN WAS ENGAGED IN THE EVENTS THEN TAKING PLACE IN RUSSIA THE LESS DID HE REALIZE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN PETERSBURG AND IN THE PROVINCES AT A DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0011.flac,WEPT FOR RUSSIA AND ITS ANCIENT CAPITAL AND TALKED OF SELF SACRIFICE AND SO ON BUT IN THE ARMY WHICH RETIRED BEYOND MOSCOW THERE WAS LITTLE TALK OR THOUGHT OF MOSCOW

train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0034.flac,NOW TURNED ON MOSCOW THE ARMY AND NAPOLEON THE SOCIETY GATHERED TOGETHER AT THE GOVERNOR'S WAS THE BEST IN VORONEZH
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0041.flac,WHO WELCOMED ROSTOV AS A NEAR RELATIVE AND CALLED HIM NICHOLAS
train-clean-360/3835/178030/3835-178030-0045.flac,WITH THE NAIVE CONVICTION OF YOUNG MEN IN A MERRY MOOD THAT OTHER MEN'S WIVES WERE CREATED FOR THEM
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0001.flac,ON A NOVEMBER EVENING IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0002.flac,BUT AN UNWONTED INTEREST ATTACHED TO THIS EVENING'S GATHERING
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0003.flac,THOUGH IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN THEY EXCITED THE GREATEST CURIOSITY FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0004.flac,AND ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HER DOOR HAD BEEN SHUT ON THE GROUND OF INDISPOSITION
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0005.flac,EXISTENCE IS IN SOME SORT INCOMPLETE BUT IN THOSE TIMES WHEN THE LEAST INDISCRETION ON THE PART OF AN ARISTOCRAT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0017.flac,AND THESE MEN WEIGHED THEMSELVES AND INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT THEY WERE FOUND WANTING SUCH A NATURE DEMANDED AN EXALTED PASSION MOREOVER
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0023.flac,AND BETWEEN THESE TWO THERE WAS THE DEEP SYMPATHY OF KINDRED SOULS
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0024.flac,THEY WOULD INSTINCTIVELY HAVE FELT FOR EACH OTHER A FRIENDSHIP THAT IS RARELY MET WITH BETWEEN TWO MEN
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0025.flac,AND HAD MADE IT A POINT OF HONOR TO FOLLOW THE EMIGRANT PRINCES INTO EXILE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0026.flac,SHE WAS RICH NOBLE AND THE MOTHER OF AN EMIGRANT WITH THE ONE DESIRE TO LOOK AFTER HER SON'S GREAT FORTUNE SHE HAD DENIED HERSELF THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WITH HIM
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0031.flac,AND EVEN THE JUDGES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS WENT THERE THE FOUR FIRST NAMED GENTLEMEN WERE NONE OF THEM MARRIED
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0035.flac,THEY WENT TO INQUIRE INTO THE MISFORTUNE GRIEF OR ILLNESS
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0036.flac,TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS BRIGITTE THE HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED WITH THE SAME FORMULA HER MISTRESS WAS KEEPING HER ROOM AND WOULD SEE NO ONE NOT EVEN HER OWN SERVANTS
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0037.flac,THE JOKE WAS HAZARDED DISCREETLY WOMEN AND MEN ELDERLY FOLK AND YOUNG GIRLS
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0039.flac,AND THE WOMEN KIND WERE THE FIRST TO FIND OUT THAT BRIGITTE HAD LAID IN AN EXTRA STOCK OF PROVISIONS THE THING COULD NOT BE DISPUTED
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0040.flac,AND WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE HAD BOUGHT THE ONE HARE TO BE HAD
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0045.flac,THE MAYOR HAD A BELIEF IN A PRIEST WHO HAD REFUSED THE OATH
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0046.flac,BUT THIS LEFT HIM NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSED HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PURCHASE OF A HARE ON A FRIDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT HAD STRONG LEANINGS TOWARD A CHOUAN CHIEF
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0050.flac,THE OLD MERCHANT TOOK A BOLDER STEP HE CALLED THAT MORNING UPON THE LADY STRONG IN THE THOUGHT OF THE SERVICE HE MEANT TO DO HER
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0052.flac,THE COUNTESS'S FACE WORE A STRANGE LOOK THAT CONFIRMED HIS SUSPICIONS DEEPLY MOVED BY THE DEVOTION SO NATURAL TO WOMEN
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0055.flac,THAT MADE HIM TREMBLE OLD THOUGH HE WAS COME IN SHE SAID
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0060.flac,AND HE IMPLORED HIS MOTHER TO SEND A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY BY THE BEARER WHO HAD GONE THROUGH DANGERS INNUMERABLE TO DELIVER IT THE PAPER SHOOK IN THE OLD MAN'S HANDS
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0062.flac,AFTER THE TWO HAD AGREED TOGETHER AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO AND SAY THE OLD MERCHANT WENT ON VARIOUS INGENIOUS PRETEXTS TO PAY VISITS TO THE PRINCIPAL HOUSES OF CARENTAN
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0070.flac,THE FLOOR WAS NOT EVEN POLISHED SHE HAD LEFT THE OLD SOMBER HANGINGS ON THE WALLS HAD KEPT THE OLD FASHIONED COUNTRY FURNITURE BURNED TALLOW CANDLES
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0074.flac,SEVERAL TIMES THEY PUT AWKWARD QUESTIONS WHICH THE COUNTESS ANSWERED WITH WONDERFUL PRESENCE OF MIND SO BRAVE IS A MOTHER'S HEART
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0083.flac,I WOULD STAKE MY SALVATION ON IT GOD CANNOT BE MISTAKEN IF ONLY I COULD SEE HIM HERE IN THE HOUSE IN SPITE OF THE DANGER
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0086.flac,BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE COMPLAINED OF FEELING UNWELL AND WENT TO SIT IN HER GREAT CHAIR BY THE FIRESIDE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0091.flac,THE MOON SHONE ON THE PASTURE LAND ABOUT CARENTAN BUT HE HAD NOTICED GREAT MASSES OF WHITE CLOUD THAT WERE ABOUT TO SCATTER SHOWERS OF SNOW OVER THE COUNTRY
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0095.flac,ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT HE ADDED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND SEEING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WE KNOW WHERE TO SEND YOU
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0096.flac,AND HE HANDED OVER THE BILLET
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0097.flac,THE CONSCRIPT READ THE DIRECTION CURIOUSLY HE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT HE HAS NOT FAR TO GO

train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0099.flac,THE CLOCKS IN CARENTAN STRUCK HALF PAST NINE AS HE SPOKE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0102.flac,THAT REDOUBTABLE FUNCTIONARY WAS ALONE WITH THE COUNTESS WHO WAITED TREMBLING TILL HE SHOULD GO THERE WAS SOMETHING APPALLING IN THEIR LONG SILENCE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0103.flac,I AM HERE TO SEE THAT THE LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC ARE CARRIED OUT
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0117.flac,PERMIT MY SERVANTS TO SUPPLY MY PLACE
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0121.flac,BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG THE DREADFUL QUIET SUCCEEDED AGAIN TOWARD MORNING THE COUNTESS WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO HER ROOM
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0123.flac,AS IF HE HAD BEEN IN A STABLE THAT MUST HAVE KILLED HER
train-clean-360/3851/9210/3851-9210-0124.flac,AND DOUBTLESS SOME DREADFUL VISION

train-clean-360/3852/175448/3852-175448-0020.flac,OF COURSE TRAVELLERS OF THIS KIND NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THEMSELVES DO NOT QUALIFY THEM TO SPEAK AS WILDERNESS EXPLORERS
train-clean-360/3852/175448/3852-175448-0031.flac,BATES CAME TO THE AMAZON JUST BEFORE THE ERA OF AMAZONIAN STEAMBOATS HE NEVER WENT OFF THE NATIVE ROUTES OF ORDINARY TRAVEL BUT HE WAS A DEVOTED AND ABLE NATURALIST

train-clean-360/3852/175448/3852-175448-0059.flac,INSTEAD OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OR BODILY CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ANIMAL OR SPECIES AND OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS NOTHING WHATEVER BUT THE ENVIRONMENT
train-clean-360/3852/175448/3852-175448-0068.flac,THE OPPOSITE VIEW IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE GREAT LAND MASSES ALIKE IN THE TROPICS IN THE SOUTH TEMPERATE ZONE AND IN THE ANTARCTIC REGION

train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0002.flac,THE SURFACE UNDULATES CONSIDERABLY ABOUT THIS LATITUDE IT WAS MORE EVIDENT TO DAY THAN WHEN WE WERE OUTWARD BOUND NIGHT CAMP R TWO
train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0004.flac,IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS SANDY SNOW WAS DRIFTED ABOUT LIKE SAND FROM PLACE TO PLACE HOW ACCOUNT FOR THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR THREE DAY OLD TRACKS AND THE MONTH OLD ONES OF THE NORWEGIANS
train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0006.flac,I'M AFRAID THE RETURN JOURNEY IS GOING TO BE DREADFULLY TIRING AND MONOTONOUS
train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0008.flac,WAS BLOWING QUITE HARD AND DRIFTING WHEN WE STARTED OUR AFTERNOON MARCH AT FIRST WITH FULL SAIL WE WENT ALONG AT A GREAT RATE THEN WE GOT ON TO AN EXTRAORDINARY SURFACE

train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0017.flac,I THINK ABOUT THE MOST TIRING MARCH WE HAVE HAD SOLID PULLING THE WHOLE WAY IN SPITE OF THE LIGHT SLEDGE AND SOME LITTLE HELPING WIND AT FIRST
train-clean-360/3927/6556/3927-6556-0018.flac,THEN IN THE LAST PART OF THE AFTERNOON THE SUN CAME OUT AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WE HAD THE WHOLE SURFACE COVERED WITH SOFT SNOW

train-clean-360/3967/29012/3967-29012-0012.flac,THE PRINCESS IS A MASSIVE LADY WITH THE ORGANISATION OF AN ATHLETE
train-clean-360/3967/29012/3967-29012-0015.flac,MADE IN THE NIGHT OF AGES TO LAST AND BE TRANSMITTED
train-clean-360/3967/29012/3967-29012-0024.flac,ONLY BELIEVE THAT I FEEL A SORT OF TERROR IT'S STRANGE WHEN SHE'S SO KIND
train-clean-360/3967/29012/3967-29012-0047.flac,IF YOU CAN'T DISSEMBLE YOUR LOVE I ASKED AS LADY AUGUSTA WAS VAGUE
train-clean-360/3967/292604/3967-292604-0007.flac,I SAT UP IN MY BED WITH MY HEART BEATING VERY QUICK
train-clean-360/3967/292604/3967-292604-0009.flac,AND THEN STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF ME BETWEEN THE TWO POSTS OF THE BED FOOT I SAW SOMETHING WHITE THAT WAVERED AND SWAYED THIS WAY AND THAT
train-clean-360/3967/292604/3967-292604-0012.flac,I REMEMBERED THE WEIRD SCREECHING SOUND WHICH I HAD HEARD IN THE HOLLOW I THINK THAT IN MY HEART I BEGGED DICK PARMITER'S PARDON FOR LAUGHING AT HIS FEARS
train-clean-360/3967/292604/3967-292604-0047.flac,HAD NOT A FISHER BOY BURST ONE NIGHT INTO LIEUTENANT CLUTTERBUCK'S LODGING OFF THE STRAND
train-clean-360/3972/170212/3972-170212-0004.flac,ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE WALL AND AS AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY AGAINST THE CONSTANT DANGER A HEDGE OF THE RHAMNUS HAD BEEN PLANTED
train-clean-360/3972/170212/3972-170212-0007.flac,THERE WERE SIX OF THESE MEN OMITTING THE WATCHMAN AND AFTERWHILE THEY ASSEMBLED IN A GROUP NEAR THE FIRE SOME SITTING SOME LYING PRONE
train-clean-360/3972/170212/3972-170212-0015.flac,WHEN THE SHELIACH READ THE TEXT NONE LISTENED TO THE INTERPRETER WITH MORE ABSOLUTE FAITH AND NONE TOOK AWAY WITH THEM MORE OF THE ELDER'S SERMON OR GAVE IT MORE THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
train-clean-360/3972/170212/3972-170212-0026.flac,THEY ROSE UPON THEIR KNEES AND LOOKING WORSHIPFULLY BEHELD IN THE CENTRE OF A GREAT GLORY THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN CLAD IN A ROBE INTENSELY WHITE
train-clean-360/3972/170212/3972-170212-0031.flac,GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN NOT ONCE THE PRAISE BUT MANY TIMES
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0000.flac,I HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD IT ASSERTED BY WHITE PEOPLE AND CAN TRULY SAY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0001.flac,WITH THEIR FAMILIES IS WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0004.flac,AFTER THOMAS AND JOHN ARRIVED TO MANHOOD IN ADDITION TO THE FORMER CHARGE JOHN GOT TWO WIVES
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0005.flac,ALTHOUGH POLYGAMY WAS TOLERATED IN OUR TRIBE THOMAS CONSIDERED IT A VIOLATION OF GOOD AND WHOLESOME RULES IN SOCIETY
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0021.flac,AND SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS HAD COME IN TO ASSIST IN TAKING CARE OF THE CORPSE I HIRED SHANKS AN INDIAN TO GO TO BUFFALO
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0023.flac,THE CHIEFS SOON ASSEMBLED IN COUNCIL ON THE TRIAL OF JOHN AND AFTER HAVING SERIOUSLY EXAMINED THE MATTER ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWS JUSTIFIED HIS CONDUCT AND ACQUITTED HIM
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0025.flac,THOMAS EXCEPT WHEN INTOXICATED WHICH WAS NOT FREQUENT WAS A KIND AND TENDER CHILD WILLING TO ASSIST ME IN MY LABOR
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0026.flac,HIS NATURAL ABILITIES WERE SAID TO BE OF A SUPERIOR CAST AND HE SOARED ABOVE THE TRIFLING SUBJECTS OF REVENGE
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0027.flac,HE WAS MANLY IN HIS DEPORTMENT COURAGEOUS AND ACTIVE AND COMMANDED RESPECT THOUGH HE APPEARED WELL PLEASED WITH PEACE
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0028.flac,AND WHEN HE RETURNED BROUGHT ONE WHITE MAN A PRISONER WHOM HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIS OWN HANDS
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0030.flac,CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE APPRIZED OF DANGER AND CONDUCTED HIM TO THE CAMP HE WAS WELL TREATED WHILE A PRISONER AND REDEEMED AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0033.flac,WHO IS AT THIS TIME TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WENT TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING A GOOD EDUCATION
train-clean-360/3972/185074/3972-185074-0035.flac,AND IS NOW AT BUFFALO WHERE I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE CONTEMPLATES COMMENCING THE STUDY OF MEDICINE AS A PROFESSION
train-clean-360/3972/5791/3972-5791-0017.flac,SUCH PROOF GIVE YOUR SOVEREIGN AND IF HE HAVE ONE SPARK OF THAT GREATNESS OF MIND WHICH YOU SAY HE POSSESSES THOUGH HE MAY NOT ADOPT YOUR ADVICE HE MUST RESPECT THE ADVISER
train-clean-360/3972/5791/3972-5791-0021.flac,BUT THOMAS EARL OF LANCASTER THE KING'S NEPHEW IS COME FROM ABROAD WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY HE IS TO CONDUCT THE SCOTTISH PRISONERS TO THE BORDERS AND THEN TO FALL UPON SCOTLAND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
train-clean-360/3972/5791/3972-5791-0024.flac,AND BEFORE THIS DAY MONTH NOT A ROOD OF LAND IN SCOTLAND IS LIKELY TO HOLD A SOUTHRON SOLDIER
train-clean-360/3972/5791/3972-5791-0029.flac,BY THE SWORD MY ANCESTORS GAINED THEIR ESTATES AND WITH THE SWORD I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO EXTEND MY TERRITORIES
train-clean-360/3977/185457/3977-185457-0003.flac,WE ARE INDEBTED TO HUBER FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE USE MADE BY THE BEES OF POLLEN THAT IT DID NOT SERVE AS FOOD FOR THE MATURE BEES
train-clean-360/3977/185457/3977-185457-0008.flac,IT MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THEY HAVE A FERTILE QUEEN AND ARE BUSY IN BREEDING ON THE CONTRARY
train-clean-360/3977/185457/3977-185457-0011.flac,HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY COLD I FOUND MANY OF THE CELLS FILLED WITH BROOD
train-clean-360/3977/185457/3977-185457-0028.flac,HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN AND OF LATE SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO FURNISH A SUBSTITUTE
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0001.flac,SO THAT WHEN SHE IS LIBERATED THE NEXT DAY THEY WILL GLADLY ADOPT HER IN PLACE OF THE ONE THEY HAVE LOST
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0002.flac,THEY WILL GNAW THE WAX AWAY AND LIBERATE HER THEMSELVES FROM HER CONFINEMENT QUEENS THAT SEEM BENT ON DEPARTING TO THE WOODS MAY BE CONFINED IN THE SAME WAY
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0014.flac,PERHAPS THEY DID NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT WARMTH OR WERE NOT TREATED IN SOME OTHER IMPORTANT RESPECTS
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0027.flac,MAY DISPENSE ENTIRELY WITH ANY PROTECTION I FIND IN SHORT THAT THE RISK OF BEING STUNG IS REALLY DIMINISHED BY THE USE OF MY HIVES
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0034.flac,BE PERMITTED TO PUT ON RECORD THE PREDICTION THAT MOVABLE FRAMES WILL IN DUE SEASON BE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY EMPLOYED
train-clean-360/3977/185466/3977-185466-0036.flac,SO PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND YET SO EFFICACIOUS OF GAINING THE CONTROL OF THE COMBS BY THESE FRAMES
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0006.flac,AS NEAR AS I CAN RECOLLECT ONE SIXTH OR AT LEAST ONE EIGHTH OF THE WHOLE CONVERTED INTO A PERMANENT AIR NOT IMBIBED BY WATER
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0009.flac,I HAVE OBSERVED FERMENT WITH GREAT HEAT IN NITROUS AIR AND I HAVE SINCE OBSERVED THAT THIS PROCESS IS ATTENDED WITH GREATER HEAT IN FIXED AIR THAN IN COMMON AIR
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0013.flac,MIGHT ALSO YIELD SOME FIXED AIR WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE CONTAINED IN THE SALT OF TARTAR FROM WHICH IT IS MADE I MIXED THE TWO INGREDIENTS VIZ SALT OF TARTAR AND BRIMSTONE
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0018.flac,FIXED AIR WAS NOT SO MUCH INCREASED AS THE REST AND PHLOGISTICATED AIR LESS BUT AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE WATER
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0019.flac,THE VAPOURS BEING SOON CONDENSED BY COLD LIKE THE VAPOUR OF WATER
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0023.flac,AND THAT ANY PART OF IT BEING ONCE FIRED
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0026.flac,WHICH IT DID WITHOUT ANY IGNITION OF THE INFLAMMABLE AIR ITSELF THE QUANTITY INCREASED REGULARLY
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0028.flac,I SET FIRE TO THE PAPER IMMEDIATELY UPON WHICH THERE WAS A PRODUCTION OF AIR
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0034.flac,AND HAVING CAREFULLY EXHAUSTED IT BY A PUMP OF MISTER SMEATON'S CONSTRUCTION I FILLED THE RECEIVER WITH ANY KIND OF AIR
train-clean-360/3977/87547/3977-87547-0039.flac,I BURNED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF GUNPOWDER IN AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0005.flac,MY LORD HE SAID AT LAST I DO KNOW THE ROAD FOR WHICH YOU ASK
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0015.flac,AND IT NEVER RELAXED ITS SPEED TILL THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS REACHED THEN IT CAME TO A SUDDEN HALT AND THE PRINCE AT ONCE GOT DOWN AND FLUNG THE BRIDLE ON HIS HORSE'S NECK
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0017.flac,HIM AT ONCE KILL HIM SHRIEKED OTHERS
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0018.flac,HE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MAN I AM SURE THE BIRD AND THE CAGE MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT FOR HIM
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0022.flac,AND IT IS I WHO HAVE KILLED YOU FOOL THAT I WAS TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THAT TEMPTRESS
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0023.flac,PRINCE PERVIZ'S GRIEF AT HIS BROTHER'S LOSS WAS NOT LESS THAN THAT OF PRINCESS PARIZADE BUT HE DID NOT WASTE HIS TIME ON USELESS LAMENTATIONS
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0024.flac,AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER OBJECT IN DOING SO
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0037.flac,AS FAR AS I CAN SEE SAID THE PRINCESS THE FIRST THING IS NOT TO MIND THE TUMULT OF THE VOICES THAT FOLLOW YOU TILL YOU REACH THE CAGE AND THEN NEVER TO LOOK BEHIND
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0038.flac,BUT AS IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED BY THE VOICES
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0039.flac,LET THEM MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS THEY LIKE I SHALL HEAR NOTHING MADAM CRIED THE DERVISH OUT OF ALL THE NUMBER WHO HAVE ASKED ME THE WAY TO THE MOUNTAIN
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0041.flac,IN SPITE OF THE COTTON SOME ECHOES OF THE VOICES REACHED HER EARS BUT NOT SO AS TO TROUBLE HER INDEED THOUGH THEY GREW LOUDER AND MORE INSULTING THE HIGHER SHE CLIMBED
train-clean-360/3979/10701/3979-10701-0056.flac,AND THE KNIGHTS WHO STOOD BY DECLARED THEMSELVES HER SLAVES AND READY TO CARRY OUT HER WISHES BUT THE PRINCESS WHILE THANKING THEM FOR THEIR POLITENESS EXPLAINED THAT SHE WISHED FOR NO COMPANY BUT THAT OF HER BROTHERS
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0007.flac,AND WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO NOTHING WITHOUT CONSULTING ALL THREE TOGETHER ASK HER ADVICE THEN REPLIED THE SULTAN AND TO MORROW COME AND HUNT WITH ME AND GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0019.flac,AND ALOUD HE COMPLIMENTED THEM ON THEIR LEARNING AND TASTE FOR KNOWLEDGE
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0027.flac,THE HUNT BEGAN AND CONTINUED TILL MID DAY WHEN THE HEAT BECAME SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LEAVE OFF
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0029.flac,BY THIS TIME THE PRINCESS HAD RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST EMBARRASSMENT OF MEETING AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE HER SPEECH OF WELCOME
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0030.flac,IT CANNOT COMPARE WITH THE GREAT CITY MANSIONS MUCH LESS OF COURSE WITH THE SMALLEST OF THE SULTAN'S PALACES
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0031.flac,AND I WILL RESERVE MY JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE SHOWN ME THE WHOLE THE PRINCESS THEN LED THE WAY FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND THE SULTAN EXAMINED EVERYTHING CAREFULLY
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0035.flac,WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN YOUR MUSICIANS HE ASKED THE PRINCESS ARE THEY UP IN THE AIR OR UNDER THE EARTH SURELY THE OWNERS OF SUCH CHARMING VOICES OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0039.flac,AND I AM DYING TO SEE THE TALKING BIRD THE SULTAN COULD HARDLY TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE GOLDEN WATER WHICH PUZZLED HIM MORE AND MORE
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0041.flac,ON APPROACHING THE HOUSE THE SULTAN NOTICED A VAST QUANTITY OF BIRDS WHOSE VOICES FILLED THE AIR
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0044.flac,THE BIRD STOPPED SINGING AT ONCE AND ALL THE OTHER BIRDS STOPPED TOO THE SULTAN IS WELCOME HE SAID I WISH HIM LONG LIFE AND ALL PROSPERITY
train-clean-360/3979/10702/3979-10702-0055.flac,THE PRINCES ON EACH SIDE OF THEIR FATHER AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MOTHER LONG BEFORE THEY REACHED THE GATES THE WAY WAS LINED WITH PEOPLE
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0000.flac,IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0010.flac,WHO WOULD HAVE NO SUCH STANDARDS
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0011.flac,HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0014.flac,THOSE WHO HAVE LAUGHED AT ME LITTLE KNOW HOW MUCH REASON MY IDEAS ARE BASED UPON HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE VILLAGE BELOW
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0015.flac,THEY FANCY THAT THEY COMPREHEND THE UNIVERSE I SMILED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO GO ON
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0016.flac,THE GREATER PART OF MY LIFE FORTY THREE YEARS IN ALL YOU MAY NOT THINK IT BUT I AM ABOVE EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0017.flac,I SAID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVICEABLE
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0018.flac,MY EXPERIENCE UPON A CERTAIN OCCASION I MIGHT SAY
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0021.flac,AND WHEN I MADE PORT AT LAST IT WAS TOO LATE TO DELAY IN THOSE NORTHERN WATERS WITH SUCH A VESSEL AND SUCH A CREW AS I HAD
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0025.flac,I WA'N'T CAUGHT ASTERN O THE LIGHTER
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0030.flac,AND WOULD NOT ANSWER THE RUDDER OR PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE MOST CAREFUL SETTING OF SAILS SO THERE WE WERE BLOWIN ALONG ANYWAYS HE COMPLAINED
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0031.flac,THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE UNKINDLY WANDERING HE CEASED TO SPEAK
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0032.flac,FOR JUST THAT CLASS O MEN
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0035.flac,AND LIKE'S NOT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN SAW IT WITH THEM
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0037.flac,SHIPPING'S A TERRIBLE LOSS TO THIS PART O NEW ENGLAND FROM A SOCIAL POINT O VIEW MA'AM I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF I RETURNED
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0039.flac,AND SOME WERE GREAT ON MEDICINE
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0041.flac,AND TALK A TERRIBLE WHILE ABOUT THEIR HAVIN SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF KEEPIN EM HE WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST CAPTAINS
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0043.flac,RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURE MEASUREMENTS SAME'S OTHER SAILORS MAKE LITTLE SHIPS AND DESIGN NEW TRICKS OF RIGGING
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0045.flac,AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY STAYED THERE AND HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
train-clean-360/398/123602/398-123602-0047.flac,BUT WE COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE WATER ON A BEACH BELOW IT SOUNDED LIKE THE STRANGE WARNING WAVE THAT GIVES NOTICE OF THE TURN OF THE TIDE
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0002.flac,A CERTAIN TALL SOLDIER DEVELOPED VIRTUES AND WENT RESOLUTELY TO WASH A SHIRT
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0003.flac,HE WAS SWELLED WITH A TALE HE HAD HEARD FROM A RELIABLE FRIEND
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0004.flac,WHO HAD HEARD IT FROM HIS TRUSTWORTHY BROTHER ONE OF THE ORDERLIES AT DIVISION HEADQUARTERS

train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0023.flac,AND WITH NO APPARENT DIFFICULTY GIVE HIM MANY HUNDREDS OF REASONS WHY HE WAS OF VASTLY MORE IMPORTANCE ON THE FARM THAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0026.flac,ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN BED
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0032.flac,HE HAD PRIVATELY PRIMED HIMSELF FOR A BEAUTIFUL SCENE

train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0047.flac,BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0048.flac,AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0049.flac,HE HAD FELT GROWING WITHIN HIM THE STRENGTH TO DO MIGHTY DEEDS OF ARMS AFTER COMPLICATED JOURNEYINGS WITH MANY PAUSES
train-clean-360/398/130093/398-130093-0050.flac,WAS A SERIES OF DEATH STRUGGLES WITH SMALL TIME IN BETWEEN FOR SLEEP AND MEALS BUT SINCE HIS REGIMENT HAD COME TO THE FIELD THE ARMY HAD DONE LITTLE

train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0002.flac,WITH ME FOR USE IN CASE AN OPPORTUNITY SUCH AS THIS SHOULD ARISE AND LED BY THE SWAHILI I STARTED MOST CAREFULLY TO STALK THE LIONS
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0005.flac,AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I POSTED THEM IN A HALF CIRCLE ROUND THE THICKET AND GAVE THE HEAD JEMADAR
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0006.flac,I THEN CREPT ROUND BY MYSELF AND SOON FOUND A GOOD POSITION AND ONE WHICH THE LION WAS MOST LIKELY TO RETREAT PAST
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0007.flac,AND MY SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF BAGGING HIM WAS UNBOUNDED SLOWLY HE ADVANCED ALONG THE PATH STOPPING EVERY FEW SECONDS TO LOOK ROUND
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0009.flac,FOR HE STUCK HIS FOREFEET INTO THE GROUND THREW HIMSELF BACK ON HIS HAUNCHES AND GROWLED SAVAGELY AS I COVERED HIS BRAIN WITH MY RIFLE
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0013.flac,I EVENTUALLY LOST HIS TRAIL IN A ROCKY PATCH OF GROUND BITTERLY DID I ANATHEMATISE THE HOUR IN WHICH I HAD RELIED ON A BORROWED WEAPON
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0014.flac,THE CAP BEING ONLY SLIGHTLY DENTED SO THAT THE WHOLE FAULT DID INDEED LIE WITH THE RIFLE
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0019.flac,WHERE A PLANK WAS LASHED TO SERVE AS A SEAT FURTHER AS THE NIGHTS WERE STILL PITCH DARK I HAD THE DONKEY'S CARCASE
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0020.flac,AT SUNDOWN THEREFORE I TOOK UP MY POSITION ON MY AIRY PERCH
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0021.flac,OF MY GUN BEARER MAHINA I DECIDED TO GO ALONE I WOULD GLADLY HAVE TAKEN HIM WITH ME INDEED BUT HE HAD A BAD COUGH
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0026.flac,TOLD ME THAT MY PRESENCE HAD BEEN NOTICED AND I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT DISAPPOINTMENT AWAITED ME ONCE MORE BUT NO MATTERS QUICKLY TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0028.flac,EVERY MOMENT I EXPECTED HIM TO RUSH IT AND THE STAGING HAD NOT BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH AN EYE TO SUCH A POSSIBILITY IF ONE OF THE RATHER FLIMSY POLES SHOULD BREAK
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0029.flac,AND HEARTILY REPENTED MY FOLLY IN HAVING PLACED MYSELF IN SUCH A DANGEROUS POSITION I KEPT PERFECTLY STILL HOWEVER
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0030.flac,AND MY FEELINGS MAY BE BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0031.flac,FOR A MOMENT I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT I NEARLY FELL OFF THE PLANK
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0035.flac,AT LENGTH CAME A SERIES OF MIGHTY GROANS GRADUALLY SUBSIDING INTO DEEP SIGHS AND FINALLY CEASING ALTOGETHER
train-clean-360/4590/18004/4590-18004-0040.flac,AFTER PLAYING ME SO MANY EXASPERATING TRICKS HAD REALLY TURNED AT LAST I HAD SCARCELY TRACED THE BLOOD FOR MORE THAN A FEW PACES WHEN ON ROUNDING A BUSH
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0000.flac,THE DEATH OF THE SECOND MAN EATER
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0003.flac,FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A VACANT IRON SHANTY CLOSE AT HAND WITH A CONVENIENT LOOPHOLE IN IT FOR FIRING FROM AND OUTSIDE THIS I PLACED THREE FULL GROWN GOATS AS BAIT
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0004.flac,THE SAME TIME DRAGGING AWAY THE OTHERS RAIL AND ALL I FIRED SEVERAL SHOTS IN HIS DIRECTION
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0007.flac,RUSHING THROUGH THE BUSHES AT A GREAT PACE IN AN INSTANT EVERY MAN OF THE PARTY SCRAMBLED HASTILY UP THE NEAREST TREE
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0008.flac,WHO STOOD STEADILY BY ME THROUGHOUT
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0009.flac,WHERE WE HAD LAST SEEN HIM WE GUESSED BY THE SILENCE THAT HE HAD SLUNK OFF WE THEREFORE ADVANCED CAUTIOUSLY AND ON GETTING UP TO THE PLACE
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0016.flac,PASSED THROUGH TSAVO ON A TOUR OF INSPECTION ON BEHALF OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE AFTER EXAMINING THE BRIDGE AND OTHER WORKS AND EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0017.flac,ONE OR TWO OF WHICH HE HAS KINDLY ALLOWED ME TO REPRODUCE IN THIS BOOK
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0019.flac,AS IT HAPPENED THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OUR ENEMY FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER THIS AND WE BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE HAD DIED OF HIS WOUNDS IN THE BUSH
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0024.flac,I KEPT WATCH UNTIL ABOUT TWO A M WHEN I ROUSED MAHINA TO TAKE HIS TURN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR I SLEPT PEACEFULLY WITH MY BACK TO THE TREE
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0026.flac,WHEN I FANCIED I SAW SOMETHING MOVE A LITTLE WAY OFF AMONG THE LOW BUSHES
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0027.flac,IT WAS THE MAN EATER CAUTIOUSLY STALKING US THE GROUND WAS FAIRLY OPEN ROUND OUR TREE WITH ONLY A SMALL BUSH EVERY HERE AND THERE
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0029.flac,SO I DETERMINED TO RUN NO UNDUE RISK OF LOSING HIM THIS TIME I ACCORDINGLY WAITED UNTIL HE GOT QUITE CLOSE ABOUT TWENTY YARDS AWAY
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0030.flac,I HEARD THE BULLET STRIKE HIM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD NO KNOCKDOWN EFFECT
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0037.flac,AND THE FIRST SHOT I FIRED FROM IT SEEMED TO GIVE HIM HIS QUIETUS
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0038.flac,RATHER FOOLISHLY I AT ONCE SCRAMBLED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WALKED UP TOWARDS HIM
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0042.flac,THE NEWS OF THE DEATH OF THE SECOND DEVIL SOON SPREAD FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COUNTRY

train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0056.flac,WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN REGARDED AS HIS MAIN SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE CARNIVORA THESE CARED NOTHING
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0059.flac,IT WAS NOT THE SPORT BUT THE DUTY OF KINGS AND WAS IN ITSELF A TITLE TO BE A RULER OF MEN
train-clean-360/4590/18005/4590-18005-0060.flac,FROM THE STORY OF THE TSAVO RIVER WE CAN APPRECIATE THEIR SERVICES TO MAN EVEN AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0000.flac,CHAPTER TEN THE COMPLETION OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE WHEN ALL THE EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DREAD OF THE MAN EATERS WORK WENT ON BRISKLY
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0007.flac,TEARING UP TREES BY THE ROOTS AND WHIRLING THEM ALONG LIKE STRAWS STEADILY HIGHER AND HIGHER ROSE THE FLOOD AND STANDING ON MY BRIDGE I WATCHED EXPECTANTLY
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0008.flac,WE HAD BUILT ACROSS THE STREAM IN ORDER TO BRING STONE AND SAND TO THE MAIN WORK TO GIVE WAY BEFORE THE EVER RISING VOLUME OF WATER
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0010.flac,THERE WAS A DULL THUD AND A RENDING AND RIVING OF TIMBERS AND THEN THE FLOOD ROLLED ON
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0012.flac,WITH A SULLEN PLUNGE AGAINST THE CUTWATERS OF MY STONE PIERS THE SHOCK WAS GREAT BUT TO MY IMMENSE SATISFACTION THE BRIDGE TOOK IT WITHOUT A TREMOR
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0013.flac,ON ITS JOURNEY TO THE OCEAN I CONFESS THAT I WITNESSED THE WHOLE OCCURRENCE WITH A THRILL OF PRIDE
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0016.flac,THEM SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN ONE WANTONLY DESTROYED A WHOLE HERD OF MINE
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0018.flac,I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THE INTRUDER WAS ONE OF THE DEMONS
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0019.flac,IN SPITE OF THESE HOWEVER IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE NOISE DIED DOWN AND EVERYTHING BECAME STILL AGAIN
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0020.flac,THE SHED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THERE TO MY INTENSE ANGER I FOUND EVERY ONE OF MY SHEEP AND GOATS LYING STRETCHED DEAD ON THE GROUND WITH ITS THROAT BITTEN THROUGH
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0021.flac,AND I SAW FROM THIS AND FROM THE TRACKS ALL ROUND THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER HAD BEEN A LEOPARD
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0022.flac,I HOPED THAT HE WOULD RETURN THE NEXT NIGHT TO MAKE A MEAL
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0023.flac,I ACCORDINGLY LEFT THE CARCASES EXACTLY AS THEY LAY AND HAVING A VERY POWERFUL STEEL TRAP
train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0025.flac,NOR WERE WE DISAPPOINTED FOR ABOUT MIDNIGHT WE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE POWERFUL SPRING

train-clean-360/4590/18006/4590-18006-0032.flac,AND THEN TO TAKE THE MEAT I OF COURSE ASSENTED TO THIS PROPOSAL AND IN A VERY FEW MINUTES THE SKIN HAD BEEN NEATLY TAKEN OFF AND THE FAMISHING NATIVES BEGAN A RAVENOUS MEAL ON THE RAW FLESH

train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0010.flac,THE MOTIVE WAS TOO COMMON TO BE WONDERED AT
train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0013.flac,DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME
train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0014.flac,ELINOR WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO DECLINE HER INVITATION AND BY CHANGING THE SUBJECT PUT A STOP TO HER ENTREATIES SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT AS THEY LIVED IN THE SAME COUNTY

train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0016.flac,BUT IF HE WERE EVER SO MUCH THERE

train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0019.flac,AND SO WE BEGAN TALKING OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER AND I SAID TO HIM SO COLONEL THERE IS A NEW FAMILY COME TO BARTON COTTAGE I HEAR
train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0020.flac,AND WHAT DID THE COLONEL SAY
train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0022.flac,HE SEEMS AN EXCELLENT MAN AND I THINK HIM UNCOMMONLY PLEASING
train-clean-360/472/129979/472-129979-0027.flac,A GREAT WHILE EVER SINCE MY SISTER MARRIED HE WAS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF SIR JOHN'S I BELIEVE SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0006.flac,AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0008.flac,ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0009.flac,AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0013.flac,LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0015.flac,WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0018.flac,INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
train-clean-360/472/129983/472-129983-0022.flac,WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0000.flac,SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0005.flac,AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0006.flac,AND THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES AT ALL TO WHAT I USED TO THINK
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0008.flac,I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART BUT REALLY YOU DID NOT LOOK IT
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0010.flac,THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0011.flac,AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0015.flac,BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0017.flac,SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF LUCY NOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS HERSELF TO DETER HER FROM SAYING THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIM
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0021.flac,AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD AND ALMOST EVERY THING THAT WAS SAID PROCEEDED FROM ELINOR
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0026.flac,SAID EDWARD WILLING TO SAY ANY THING THAT MIGHT INTRODUCE ANOTHER SUBJECT NOT AT ALL

train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0031.flac,AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING EVERY ENGAGEMENT HOWEVER MINUTE
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0032.flac,HE IS THE MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH OF ANY BODY I EVER SAW EDWARD IT IS SO AND I WILL SAY IT
train-clean-360/472/129994/472-129994-0036.flac,IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0002.flac,HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0007.flac,THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0011.flac,WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0012.flac,HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0015.flac,OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0016.flac,SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0017.flac,IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT
train-clean-360/472/130755/472-130755-0027.flac,BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE

train-clean-360/4731/58193/4731-58193-0021.flac,IT SEEMS THAT MISTER BINGHAM HAD PLEDGED HIMSELF TO MISSUS BURWELL TO SUBDUE WHAT HE CALLED MY STUBBORN PRIDE ON FRIDAY FOLLOWING THE SATURDAY ON WHICH I WAS SO SAVAGELY BEATEN

train-clean-360/480/127525/480-127525-0033.flac,TO ADD TO OUR CONCERN
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0002.flac,BUT POOR KELLER'S ILLNESS MADE THAT IMPOSSIBLE
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0003.flac,TO ASK PARTICULARLY IN WHAT FORM THE ILLNESS DECLARED ITSELF
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0005.flac,I NATURALLY ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT I WISH I COULD GIVE HER EXPLANATION DAVID IN HER OWN DELIGHTFUL WORDS
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0010.flac,AND THAT ONLY A PART OF THE REMEDY HAD BEEN USED THE BOTTLE MIGHT STILL PERHAPS BE FOUND AT WURZBURG
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0015.flac,SO LONG AS IT IS WANTED IN THIS HOUSE HE OPENED AN OLD CABINET
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0026.flac,I WAS FAR FROM BLAMING HIM AND I SAID SO IN HIS PLACE I SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID WE ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD WRITE TO FRITZ BY THAT NIGHT'S MAIL
train-clean-360/4800/38660/4800-38660-0030.flac,AND DECLINED ANY FURTHER ATTENDANCE ON THE PATIENT AND WHO DO YOU THINK FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE DAVID
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0002.flac,AND SITUATE IN THE MIDST OF VAST GARDENS FULL OF WALLS OF LAUREL
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0006.flac,THERE WERE GUITARS OF THE CITY AND OF FLORENCE AND EVEN AN ENGLISH PIANO A LIBRARY OF THE CHOICEST MUSIC AND ALL THE MATERIALS OF ART
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0007.flac,THE AIR OF ELEGANCE AND CHEERFUL COMFORT THAT PERVADED THESE APARTMENTS SO UNUSUAL IN THIS LAND THE BRIGHT BLAZE OF THE FIRE
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0008.flac,WHICH ATTENDS AN ARRIVAL AT A STRANGE PLACE AT A LATE HOUR
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0018.flac,OR THE HUMAN VOICE WITH ITS MOST FELICITOUS SKILL STOLE UPON HER FROM THE DISTANT GALLERIES ALTHOUGH LORD MONTFORT WAS NOT HIMSELF A MUSICIAN
train-clean-360/4800/73728/4800-73728-0022.flac,WAS NOT AWARE THAT LORD MONTFORT'S DEMEANOUR TO HER DIFFERED IN ANY DEGREE FROM WHAT IT WAS AT PISA SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALONE WITH HIM IN HER LIFE
train-clean-360/4800/73729/4800-73729-0008.flac,FROM WHICH NONE ARE FREE WHICH IS A FERTILE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND WHICH WOULD AT ALL TIMES
train-clean-360/4800/73729/4800-73729-0014.flac,I WONDER HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON ME WITH CONTEMPT
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0000.flac,I THOUGHT I COULD EVEN DETECT A CERTAIN SHAMEFACEDNESS IN THE GENERAL'S GLANCE MARIA PHILIPOVNA
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0002.flac,THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER SHE DEPARTED EVIDENTLY THIS WAS NOT MERE ACCIDENT AND I FELT THAT I MUST THROW SOME LIGHT UPON MATTERS IT WAS HIGH TIME THAT I DID SO
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0003.flac,SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THE PARTY HAD ALREADY GAINED SOME NOTORIETY IN THE PLACE WHICH HAD COME TO LOOK UPON THE GENERAL AS A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN OF GREAT WEALTH
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0004.flac,LATER I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE MISCHA AND NADIA FOR A WALK WHEN A SUMMONS REACHED ME FROM THE STAIRCASE THAT I MUST ATTEND THE GENERAL
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0006.flac,THAT I WAS TO LEAD THE CHILDREN ALTOGETHER AWAY FROM THE CASINO AND OUT INTO THE PARK FINALLY HIS ANGER EXPLODED AND HE ADDED SHARPLY
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0008.flac,LET US CALCULATE HE WENT ON WE MUST TRANSLATE THESE ROUBLES INTO THALERS HERE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0009.flac,THE REST WILL BE SAFE IN MY HANDS IN SILENCE I TOOK THE MONEY YOU MUST NOT BE OFFENDED AT WHAT I SAY HE CONTINUED YOU ARE TOO TOUCHY ABOUT THESE THINGS
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0012.flac,THOUGH THAT WOULD BE NONE TOO MUCH FOR MLLE BLANCHE WHO WITH HER MOTHER AND THE FRENCHMAN WAS ALSO LODGING IN OUR HOTEL
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0014.flac,OF COURSE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE KNEW ME
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0015.flac,THE GENERAL HAD FORGOTTEN TO ARRANGE OTHERWISE OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO DINE AT THE TABLE D'HOTE NEVERTHELESS
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0016.flac,AND THOUGH THE GOOD MARIA PHILIPOVNA WAS FOR SHOWING ME MY PLACE THE FACT OF MY HAVING PREVIOUSLY MET THE ENGLISHMAN MISTER ASTLEY SAVED ME
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0018.flac,ALSO HE WAS DELIGHTED THAT I SHOULD SIT NEXT HIM AT TABLE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0020.flac,HE DID SO HUMBLY AND AS THOUGH WISHING NOT WHOLLY TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS OWN DIGNITY
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0021.flac,WHY DO I CONTINUE TO DANCE ATTENDANCE UPON THE GENERAL
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0023.flac,THE GENERAL BENT UPON ME A GLANCE OF ASTONISHMENT IF ONE IS A MAN OF SELF RESPECT I WENT ON
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0026.flac,AFTER THAT A SECTION OF THE FRENCHMEN PRESENT TOOK MY PART THEY DID SO AS SOON AS I TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HOW ONCE I THREATENED TO SPIT INTO MONSIGNOR'S COFFEE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0028.flac,AFTER LISTENING POLITELY BUT WITH GREAT RESERVE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0029.flac,I WAS IN A GREAT HURRY TO DEPART BUT OF COURSE I SAT DOWN PULLED OUT A COPY OF L'OPINION NATIONALE AND FELL TO READING AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF INVECTIVE AGAINST RUSSIA WHICH IT HAPPENED TO CONTAIN
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0030.flac,AFTER WHICH I SAW THE SACRISTAN MAKE A LOW BOW TO THE VISITOR AND THEN ANOTHER BOW AS THE VISITOR TOOK HIS LEAVE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0031.flac,HE AGAIN ASKED ME TO WAIT SOON A THIRD VISITOR ARRIVED WHO LIKE MYSELF HAD COME ON BUSINESS
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0032.flac,THIS MADE ME VERY ANGRY I ROSE APPROACHED THE SACRISTAN AND TOLD HIM THAT
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0033.flac,SHOULD DARE TO COMPARE HIMSELF WITH OTHER VISITORS OF MONSIGNOR'S
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0034.flac,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT MONSIGNOR IS GOING TO PUT ASIDE HIS COFFEE FOR YOU BUT I ONLY CRIED THE LOUDER LET ME TELL YOU THAT I AM GOING TO SPIT INTO THAT COFFEE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0036.flac,IN A WORD I SHOWED HIM THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE WAY
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0037.flac,SI BETE BUT IS THAT HOW RUSSIAN SUBJECTS OUGHT TO BE TREATED WHY WHEN THEY SETTLE HERE THEY DARE NOT UTTER EVEN A WORD
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0038.flac,AT ONCE WENT UPSTAIRS WHILE SOME OF THE FRENCHMEN WERE SIMPLY DISGUSTED WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT TWO YEARS AGO I HAD ENCOUNTERED A MAN AT WHOM IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE A FRENCH HERO FIRED FOR THE MERE FUN OF DISCHARGING HIS MUSKET
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0040.flac,THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS WITH ME FOR HAVING STARTED THE ALTERCATION WITH THE FRENCHMAN
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0041.flac,AND RISING FROM THE TABLE PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0042.flac,OF COURSE WE BEGAN BY TALKING ON BUSINESS MATTERS POLINA SEEMED FURIOUS WHEN I HANDED HER ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED GULDEN

train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0059.flac,SOMETHING HAD SEEMED TO STRIKE MY BRAIN WHEN SHE TOLD ME TO GO AND PLAY ROULETTE
train-clean-360/4806/26894/4806-26894-0060.flac,ON THE DAY OF MY RETURN ALTHOUGH WHILE TRAVELLING I HAD MOPED LIKE AN IMBECILE

train-clean-360/4848/101836/4848-101836-0010.flac,AND MVOO LAANA AND HIS MOTHER WERE HUNGRY EVERY DAY WITH NOTHING TO SATISFY THEM AS THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE AT LAST HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER ONE DAY
train-clean-360/4848/101836/4848-101836-0012.flac,THE YOUTH WALKED AND WALKED BUT COULD SEE NO GAME

train-clean-360/4848/101836/4848-101836-0021.flac,WHEN HE CAME TO THE ROAD LEADING TO THE PRINCIPAL CITY HE SAW A WELL WITH A BUCKET STANDING NEAR IT
train-clean-360/4848/101836/4848-101836-0025.flac,WHEN THE SULTAN HEARD THIS HE SENT SOME SOLDIERS WHO BROUGHT MVOO LAANA AND HIS LITTLE BAG BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY OPENED THE LITTLE BAG
train-clean-360/4848/101836/4848-101836-0027.flac,BUT THE GREAT SNAKE HAD COME OUT OF THE WELL AND ARRIVED AT THE TOWN JUST ABOUT THIS TIME
train-clean-360/4848/28247/4848-28247-0002.flac,AND ACCORDINGLY THEY PERSEVERED IN FOLLOWING THAT SINGULAR BOUNDARY WHICH HAD REVEALED ITSELF TO THEIR EXTREME ASTONISHMENT
train-clean-360/4848/28247/4848-28247-0023.flac,WHICH THE LAPSE OF TIME NEVER FAILS TO WORK A SKILLED GEOLOGIST WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIGN THEM THEIR PROPER SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION
train-clean-360/4848/29108/4848-29108-0004.flac,ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT MY DEAR ALL RIGHT IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN A LITTLE WHILE
train-clean-360/4848/29108/4848-29108-0007.flac,POLLY DEAR WOMEN HAVEN'T MUCH HEAD FOR BUSINESS YOU KNOW
train-clean-360/4848/29108/4848-29108-0008.flac,WHY BLESS YOU LET THE APPROPRIATION LAG IF IT WANTS TO THAT'S NO GREAT MATTER THERE'S A BIGGER THING THAN THAT
train-clean-360/4848/29108/4848-29108-0010.flac,WE DO SOMEHOW SEEM TO MANAGE TO LIVE ON NEXT YEAR'S CROP OF CORN AND POTATOES AS A GENERAL THING WHILE THIS YEAR IS STILL DRAGGING ALONG

train-clean-360/4848/29108/4848-29108-0033.flac,A MAN WANTS PEACE A MAN DON'T WANT TO RIP AND TEAR AROUND ALL THE TIME
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0001.flac,THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST THEN HIS ESSENCE DOES NOT INVOLVE EXISTENCE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0005.flac,BECAUSE IT WOULD INVOLVE A CONTRADICTION ON THE OTHER HAND THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANCE FOLLOWS ALSO SOLELY FROM ITS NATURE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0006.flac,FROM THE LATTER IT MUST FOLLOW EITHER THAT A TRIANGLE NECESSARILY EXISTS OR THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD EXIST SO MUCH IS SELF EVIDENT
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0009.flac,AND THEREFORE WOULD BE UNABLE EITHER TO CAUSE OR TO DESTROY HIS EXISTENCE AS THEN
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0014.flac,THEREFORE A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE IN OTHER WORDS GOD
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0021.flac,WHEREFORE THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANCE MUST ARISE SOLELY FROM ITS OWN NATURE WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE BUT ITS ESSENCE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0024.flac,PROOF THE PARTS INTO WHICH SUBSTANCE AS THUS CONCEIVED WOULD BE DIVIDED EITHER WILL RETAIN THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE OR THEY WILL NOT
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0025.flac,WILL PERFORCE CONSIST OF A DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE SO THAT IN THAT CASE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0026.flac,WOULD HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THEIR WHOLE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0028.flac,IF THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE WERE DIVIDED INTO EQUAL PARTS
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0030.flac,IF THE FORMER WE SHOULD HAVE SEVERAL SUBSTANCES OF THE SAME NATURE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0031.flac,SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE COULD CEASE TO EXIST
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0034.flac,PROOF AS GOD IS A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE OF WHOM NO ATTRIBUTE THAT EXPRESSES THE ESSENCE OF SUBSTANCE CAN BE DENIED
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0035.flac,IF ANY SUBSTANCE BESIDES GOD WERE GRANTED IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED BY SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD AND THUS TWO SUBSTANCES WITH THE SAME ATTRIBUTE WOULD EXIST
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0037.flac,BUT THIS BY THE FIRST PART OF THIS PROOF IS ABSURD THEREFORE BESIDES GOD NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED OR CONCEIVED
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0038.flac,ONLY ONE SUBSTANCE CAN BE GRANTED IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT SUBSTANCE IS ABSOLUTELY INFINITE AS WE HAVE ALREADY INDICATED
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0039.flac,TWO THAT EXTENSION AND THOUGHT ARE EITHER ATTRIBUTES OF GOD
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0040.flac,PROOF BESIDES GOD
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0041.flac,NOTHING WHICH IS IN ITSELF AND IS CONCEIVED THROUGH ITSELF
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0042.flac,CAN NEITHER BE NOR BE CONCEIVED WITHOUT SUBSTANCE WHEREFORE THEY CAN ONLY BE IN THE DIVINE NATURE AND CAN ONLY THROUGH IT BE CONCEIVED
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0043.flac,WITHOUT GOD NOTHING CAN BE OR BE CONCEIVED
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0044.flac,NOTE SOME ASSERT THAT GOD LIKE A MAN CONSISTS OF BODY AND MIND AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF PASSIONS
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0046.flac,OF THIS THEY FIND EXCELLENT PROOF IN THE FACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND BY BODY A DEFINITE QUANTITY SO LONG SO BROAD SO DEEP BOUNDED BY A CERTAIN SHAPE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0049.flac,THUS THEY CLEARLY SHOW THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THEIR OWN WORDS I MYSELF HAVE PROVED SUFFICIENTLY CLEARLY AT ANY RATE IN MY OWN JUDGMENT
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0050.flac,THAT NO SUBSTANCE CAN BE PRODUCED OR CREATED BY ANYTHING OTHER THAN ITSELF FURTHER
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0061.flac,SUCH ARE THE ARGUMENTS I FIND ON THE SUBJECT IN WRITERS WHO BY THEM TRY TO PROVE THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS UNWORTHY OF THE DIVINE NATURE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0065.flac,IS NOT MEASURABLE AND CANNOT BE COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0067.flac,AND FINDING HIMSELF THEREBY LANDED IN ABSURDITIES PROCEEDS TO DENY THAT CIRCLES HAVE ANY CENTER FROM WHICH ALL LINES DRAWN TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE ARE EQUAL
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0068.flac,FOR TAKING EXTENDED SUBSTANCE WHICH CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED AS INFINITE ONE AND INDIVISIBLE
train-clean-360/4854/24731/4854-24731-0081.flac,AND FOLLOW AS I WILL SHORTLY SHOW FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS ESSENCE WHEREFORE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0004.flac,HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF ALL THAT CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF AN INFINITE INTELLECT
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0005.flac,AND NOT THROUGH AN ACCIDENT OF HIS NATURE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0006.flac,THAT GOD IS THE ABSOLUTELY FIRST CAUSE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0007.flac,AND IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANYONE PROOF
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0010.flac,AND IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANYONE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0011.flac,IT FOLLOWS ONE THAT THERE CAN BE NO CAUSE WHICH EITHER EXTRINSICALLY OR INTRINSICALLY BESIDES THE PERFECTION OF HIS OWN NATURE MOVES GOD TO ACT
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0012.flac,THAT GOD IS THE SOLE FREE CAUSE FOR GOD ALONE EXISTS BY THE SOLE NECESSITY OF HIS NATURE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0019.flac,AND THAT HE CREATES NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHICH HE HAS DECIDED BY SOME ABSOLUTE EXERCISE OF WILL TO CREATE HOWEVER
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0021.flac,AS FROM THE NATURE OF A TRIANGLE IT FOLLOWS FROM ETERNITY AND FOR ETERNITY
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0025.flac,THIS SEEMS TO BE A HYPOTHESIS MOST ABSURD AND MOST REPUGNANT TO GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE FURTHER
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0028.flac,ON THE CONTRARY THE TRUTH AND FORMAL ESSENCE OF THINGS IS AS IT IS BECAUSE IT EXISTS BY REPRESENTATION AS SUCH IN THE INTELLECT OF GOD
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0037.flac,GOD IS THE CAUSE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN HIM THIS IS OUR FIRST POINT FURTHER BESIDES GOD
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0039.flac,GOD AND ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE ETERNAL PROOF
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0040.flac,EXISTENCE APPERTAINS TO ITS NATURE OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING FOLLOWS FROM ITS DEFINITION THEREFORE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0041.flac,THAT I SAY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE ATTRIBUTES OF SUBSTANCE NOW ETERNITY APPERTAINS TO THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0042.flac,THEREFORE ETERNITY MUST APPERTAIN TO EACH OF THE ATTRIBUTES AND THUS ALL ARE ETERNAL
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0043.flac,NOTE
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0044.flac,I DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IT IS EVIDENT I REPEAT FROM THAT PROOF THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD LIKE HIS ESSENCE IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH FURTHER
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0045.flac,I HAVE PROVED THE ETERNITY OF GOD IN ANOTHER MANNER WHICH I NEED NOT HERE REPEAT
train-clean-360/4854/24732/4854-24732-0046.flac,HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD'S EXISTENCE LIKE HIS ESSENCE IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0021.flac,ALTHOUGH FINDING THAT SHE WAS NOT INCLINED TO LOOK UPON ME WITH FAVOR I HAVE HITHERTO REFRAINED FROM PRESSING MY SUIT
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0023.flac,HER FATHER ASKED NOT UNKINDLY I SUPPOSED YOU AND I HAD SETTLED THIS MATTER LONG AGO HER VOICE WAS CLEAR HER TONES UNFALTERING AS SHE REPLIED
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0034.flac,SHE REPLIED ALLOWING HIM TO PLACE IT ON HER FINGER THERE IS NO NEED TO ADVERTISE THE SITUATION PUBLICLY BESIDES
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0035.flac,THEN TURNING TO MISTER UNDERWOOD WHO STOOD LOOKING ON FROWNINGLY SOMEWHAT TROUBLED BY THE TURN MATTERS HAD TAKEN WALCOTT ADDED PLAYFULLY
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0038.flac,ANY ASSURANCE OF MY GOOD WISHES OR GOOD INTENTIONS TOWARDS YOU BUT HE CONTINUED DOUBTFULLY SHAKING HIS HEAD
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0044.flac,MISTER UNDERWOOD WALCOTT REMARKED WITH A SMILE OF AMUSEMENT I BELIEVE MISS UNDERWOOD IS ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT TO PERFECTION ANY ROLE SHE MAY ASSUME
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0045.flac,I SHALL BE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED TO RENDER HER ANY ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY POWER AS WALCOTT BADE KATE GOOD NIGHT AT A LATE HOUR HE INQUIRED
train-clean-360/4856/12103/4856-12103-0047.flac,IT WILL ANSWER AS WELL AS ANY I SUPPOSE
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0007.flac,I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER HIM QUITE OUT OF DANGER NOW
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0008.flac,I THINK WE CAN PULL HIM ROUND IF WE PERSEVERE BUT HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO SINK BACK INTO A STATE OF COMA
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0017.flac,I CAUGHT FREQUENT GLIMPSES OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S FACE BUT IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IN PROFILE
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0019.flac,THE SWIVEL EYE THE LEFT WAS TOWARDS ME AS SHE HELD THE PATIENT'S RIGHT ARM AND IT WAS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY TURNED IN MY DIRECTION
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0022.flac,AND EVEN GRACIOUS FORMS OF SPEECH SINGULARLY OUT OF AGREEMENT WITH THE CHARACTER THAT MISTER WEISS HAD GIVEN HIM I THANGYOU HE MUMBLED THICKLY
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0026.flac,THE DOCTOR THINKS IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO WALK ABOUT YOU'VE BEEN SLEEPING TOO MUCH HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SLEEP ANY MORE JUST NOW

train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0028.flac,APPARENTLY HE TOOK IN THE VERY BROAD HINT CONTAINED IN THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE FOR HE TRUDGED WEARILY AND UNSTEADILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0030.flac,FEELING VERY TIRED AM REALLY
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0031.flac,MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM ASKED I FELT HIS PULSE AND DECIDED THAT HE WAS REALLY BECOMING FATIGUED
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0034.flac,SO LOUDLY THAT THE PATIENT STARTED PERCEPTIBLY
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0043.flac,HE REPLIED DROWSILY SORRY T GIVE YOU ALL THIS TROUBLE L KEEP AWAKE
train-clean-360/4856/20410/4856-20410-0045.flac,WHEN I PERCEIVED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR ALONG THE PASSAGE A GLIMMER OF LIGHT FROM THE CARRIAGE LAMPS THE COACHMAN WAS STANDING JUST OUTSIDE

train-clean-360/4860/13185/4860-13185-0041.flac,I AM THINKING FLORA HE SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE A GRAND ISLAND TO LIVE ON FAR BETTER THAN SKYE BECAUSE IT HAS NO ROCKS ON IT
train-clean-360/4860/13185/4860-13185-0042.flac,I COULD PUT SHEEP AND CATTLE ON IT AND THEY COULD NOT GO AWAY NOR BE LIFTED BECAUSE

train-clean-360/4860/13185/4860-13185-0055.flac,LOOKED UP TO THE GUM TREE AND SAID
train-clean-360/4860/13185/4860-13185-0056.flac,THE ECHO WAS REPEATED AND THEN HE WHEELED ABOUT IN REAL EARNEST TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE A LIMB THE BLACKS WERE CLOSE TO HIM NOW

train-clean-360/510/130103/510-130103-0021.flac,BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HIS TIRELESS FATE WOULD BRING FORTH WHEN THE STRIFE LULLED FOR A MOMENT A MAN TO ASK OF HIM AN EXPLANATION
train-clean-360/510/130103/510-130103-0026.flac,WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM

train-clean-360/510/130103/510-130103-0039.flac,AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
train-clean-360/510/130103/510-130103-0042.flac,FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY

train-clean-360/5115/26951/5115-26951-0003.flac,CAVALRY IN WHICH EACH MAN LOOKED LIKE A KNIGHT ERRANT WITH HIS INDOMITABLE SPEAR AND CHARGER IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO BE ASSURED THAT THEY WOULD INJURE NOBODY BUT THE ENEMIES OF GOD

train-clean-360/5189/59288/5189-59288-0031.flac,WHO HAD BEEN SQUIRREL SHOOTING MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN TIME TO SAVE THEM QUICK QUICK YOUNG MAN YOUR GUN
train-clean-360/5189/59288/5189-59288-0034.flac,THERE NOW EXCLAIMED THE SQUIRE WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION YOU'VE GOT IT YOU UNGRATEFUL BRUTE
train-clean-360/5190/87766/5190-87766-0010.flac,IT WILL ATTEMPT TO TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE HOW TO FIND HEALTH AND HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS HOW TO WORK AND HOW TO PLAY
train-clean-360/5190/87766/5190-87766-0026.flac,WHO WATCHES YOU DAY AND NIGHT AND KNOWS EVERY THOUGHT YOU THINK
train-clean-360/5190/87766/5190-87766-0031.flac,ALSO HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A CHURCH SO HE KNOWS THE ORTHODOX TEACHINGS
train-clean-360/5190/87766/5190-87766-0037.flac,BUT SOME OF THESE LONG WORDS MEAN CERTAIN DEFINITE THINGS AND THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO SERVE THE PURPOSE
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0005.flac,THAT HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD GROW BOTH MENTALLY AND SPIRITUALLY AND MANIFESTLY THEY CANNOT ALL GROW IN THE SAME WAY IF THEY GROW DIFFERENTLY
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0013.flac,AN AGNOSTIC WHOSE WIFE A HALF EDUCATED SENTIMENTAL WOMAN TOOK TO DABBLING IN MYSTICISM
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0014.flac,IN HER BEDROOM AND CONSORTING WITH SWAMIS IN LONG YELLOW ROBES
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0020.flac,I HAVE ADVOCATED THAT THEY SHOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND TO TOLERATE EACH OTHER BUT IT IS A FACT
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0023.flac,DIVORCE LAWS SUCH AS THE CLERICAL PROPAGANDA URGES UPON US
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0024.flac,FOR THE PROMOTION OF FORNICATION AND PROSTITUTION THERE IS A SHORT STORY BY EDITH WHARTON IN WHICH THE DIVORCE EVIL
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0033.flac,THE TWO WOMEN IN THE CASE WERE NOT INTIMATE I GATHERED BUT THEY FREQUENTLY MET AT THE HOMES OF OTHERS
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0039.flac,SECOND THERE ARE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF WHICH EVERY MARRIAGE IS A TANGLE AND THE SETTLEMENT OF WHICH THE LAW SHOULD ALWAYS OVERSEE THIRD
train-clean-360/5190/87791/5190-87791-0065.flac,YOU CANNOT CHANGE HUMAN NATURE I DO NOT THINK I AM INDULGING EITHER IN RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION OR IN BLIND OPTIMISM BUT AM SPEAKING PRECISELY
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0001.flac,THE EFFECT OF THIS TANGENTIAL FORCE ACTING ON THE TIDE COMPELLING BODY IS GRADUALLY TO INCREASE ITS DISTANCE FROM THE OTHER BODY APPLYING THESE STATEMENTS TO THE EARTH AND MOON
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0002.flac,SO THAT IT TURNS ALWAYS THE SAME FACE TOWARDS US MOREOVER THAT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH IS STEADILY INCREASING
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0003.flac,LONG AGO THE MOON MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MUCH NEARER THE EARTH
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0006.flac,IT IS PROBABLY AN EXCEPTIONAL HISTORY THE PLANETS WERE NOT FORMED FROM THE SUN IN THIS WAY
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0008.flac,AND WEIGHS THEREFORE IF COMPOSED OF ROCK
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0009.flac,WE CONSIDERED THE LOCAL PECULIARITIES OF THE TIDES THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE FORMED IN OPEN OCEAN UNDER THE ACTION OF THE MOON AND THE SUN
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0023.flac,AND DENUDED AND RE FORMED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE GET AN ANSWER NOT IN FEET BUT IN MILES
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0025.flac,AND THE ONLY SOLUTION OFFERED BY GEOLOGISTS WAS UNLIMITED TIME GIVEN UNLIMITED TIME THEY COULD OF COURSE BE FORMED NO MATTER HOW SLOWLY THE PROCESS WENT ON
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0035.flac,N PLUS ONE INSTANTS OR PRACTICALLY WHEN N IS BIG
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0036.flac,AND THE TOTAL LOSS HAS AMOUNTED TO AN HOUR HENCE THE LENGTH OF AN INSTANT THE LOSS PER DIEM
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0037.flac,WHENCE ONE INSTANT EQUALS THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLIONTH PART OF A SECOND
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0038.flac,IN A YEAR THE AGGREGATE LOSS MOUNTS UP
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0039.flac,IN A CENTURY TO ABOUT THREE SECONDS AND IN THIRTY SIX CENTURIES TO AN HOUR BUT EVEN AT THE END OF THE THIRTY SIX CENTURIES THE DAY IS BARELY ANY LONGER
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0040.flac,AND EVEN A MILLION YEARS AGO UNLESS THE RATE OF LOSS WAS DIFFERENT AS IT PROBABLY WAS THE DAY WOULD ONLY BE THIRTY FIVE MINUTES SHORTER
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0041.flac,THESE NUMBERS ARE TO BE TAKEN AS ILLUSTRATIVE NOT AS PRECISELY REPRESENTING TERRESTRIAL FACT WHAT CAN HAVE CAUSED THE SLOWING DOWN
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0051.flac,WE HAVE THUS ARRIVED AT THIS FACT
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0055.flac,HOW FAST THE EARTH MUST SPIN FOR GRAVITY AT ITS SURFACE TO BE ANNULLED AND FOR PORTIONS TO FLY OFF
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0061.flac,THE RATE OF DESCRIPTION OF AREAS BY ITS RADIUS VECTOR CANNOT BE CONSTANT BUT MUST INCREASE
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0063.flac,BUT IF THE HAND BE MOVED SO AS ALWAYS TO PULL THE STRING A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE CENTRE
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0065.flac,WHICH PRACTICALLY STATES THAT THE FURTHER A PLANET IS FROM THE CENTRE THE SLOWER IT GOES ITS VELOCITY VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE SQUARE ROOT OF ITS DISTANCE
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0066.flac,IF INSTEAD OF A BALL HELD BY ELASTIC IT WERE A SATELLITE HELD BY GRAVITY AN INCREASE IN DISTANCE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A DIMINUTION IN SPEED
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0067.flac,THE TIME OF REVOLUTION VARIES AS THE SQUARE OF THE CUBE ROOT OF THE DISTANCE KEPLER'S THIRD LAW HENCE THE TIDAL REACTION ON THE MOON
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0071.flac,WORKING BACKWARDS ALSO WE SEE THAT IN PAST AGES THE MOON MUST HAVE BEEN NEARER TO US THAN IT IS NOW AND THE MONTH SHORTER
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0077.flac,IN ABOUT FIVE HOURS ALL THAT MASS OF WATER
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0079.flac,THAT ARE OF THE MOST PORTENTOUS THICKNESS
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0081.flac,BUT LET US LEAVE GEOLOGY NOW AND TRACE THE INVERTED PROGRESS OF EVENTS AS WE RECEDE IN IMAGINATION BACK THROUGH THE GEOLOGICAL ERA BEYOND
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0095.flac,SUCH A CATASTROPHE IS ALREADY IMMINENT IN A NEIGHBOURING PLANET MARS
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0100.flac,WHO HAS WORKED OUT THE ASTRONOMICAL INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SIR WILLIAM THOMSON IT IS SIR ROBERT BALL
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0102.flac,THE POWER OF ALL OF THEM IS VERY FEEBLE AND BY ACTING ON DIFFERENT SIDES THEY USUALLY PARTLY NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER'S ACTION BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY GET ALL ON ONE SIDE
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0110.flac,AND THEN BEGIN TO DIMINISH THEN INCREASE AGAIN THEN DIMINISH AND SO ON
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0111.flac,BUT THIS CONCLUSION IS NOT FINAL THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE BODIES ARE RIGID IS NOT STRICTLY TRUE
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0112.flac,ABLE IN THE LONG RUN TO UPSET ALL THEIR CALCULATIONS
train-clean-360/5206/19376/5206-19376-0115.flac,WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF MILLIONS OF YEARS SOMEWHAT FAMILIARLY
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0004.flac,I FELT MYSELF DRAWN INTO A VORTEX AND I HAD TO BRACE MYSELF FIRMLY IT WAS LIKE A GREAT EXPRESS TRAIN RUSHING BY AND I WAS DRAWN BY ITS FORCE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0005.flac,TRANSFIXED I STOOD NOT KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FLEE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0006.flac,ABOVE ITS APEX THERE APPEARED A GREAT BLACK CLOUD WHICH REACHED HIGH IN THE AIR
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0008.flac,BUT I WAS PREVENTED FROM SEEING THE DESTRUCTION BY A SPUR OF THE HILL THAT SHUT OFF THE VIEW OF THE CITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL HOW LONG I STOOD THERE INERT
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0011.flac,NEW CRATERS SEEMED TO BE OPENING ALL ABOUT THE SUMMIT AND LAVA WAS FLOWING IN BROAD STREAMS IN EVERY DIRECTION
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0012.flac,WHAT HAPPENED ON THE HORACE THE BRITISH STEAMER HORACE EXPERIENCED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPLOSION WHEN FARTHER FROM LAND
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0014.flac,WE ALL REMARKED IN THE ENGINE ROOM THAT THERE MUST BE A HEAVY STORM APPROACHING SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS EXPERIENCED DEEP WATER SEAMEN
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0015.flac,SO UNUSUALLY PECULIAR WERE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT WE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE DURING THE EVENING THAT NIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE THERE WAS A VERY BLACK SKY
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0016.flac,GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THOSE ON WATCH NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING IN THE DIRECTION OF MARTINIQUE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0017.flac,NOT UNLIKE THE ENDING OF A DEEP PEAL OF THUNDER
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0018.flac,THERE WOULD SUDDENLY COME GREAT FLASHES OF LIGHT FROM THE DARK BANK TOWARD MARTINIQUE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0021.flac,I NOTICED A SORT OF GRIT THAT GOT INTO MY MOUTH FROM THE END OF THE CIGAR I WAS SMOKING
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0026.flac,JUST AS THE STORM OF SAND WAS AT ITS HEIGHT FOURTH ENGINEER WILD WAS NEARLY SUFFOCATED BY IT BUT WAS EASILY REVIVED
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0030.flac,IT CUT DEEPER AND QUICKER AND ONLY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH WAS REQUIRED TO DO THE WORK
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0031.flac,SO WE GATHERED IT UP THAT NIGHT THERE WERE MORE OF THE SAME ELECTRIC PHENOMENA TOWARD MARTINIQUE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0034.flac,TAYLOR MANAGED TO PUSH THE CAPTAIN ON TO A HATCH THAT HAD FLOATED OFF FROM US AND THEN THEY SWAM BACK TO THE SHIP FOR MORE ASSISTANCE BUT NOTHING COULD BE DONE FOR THE CAPTAIN
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0039.flac,A FEW MINUTES LATER WE LOOKED AT HIM AND HE WAS DEAD MY OWN SON'S GONE TOO
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0041.flac,THE FOUR OF US THAT WERE LEFT HALF WAY SHIP SHAPE STARTED IN TO FIGHT THE FIRE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0044.flac,WHILE DEEP CREVICES HAD BEEN FORMED ON THE LAND A STILL GREATER EFFECT HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN PRODUCED BENEATH THE WATER
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0045.flac,THIS INDICATING A LIFT AND FALL OF THE OCEAN BED OFF THE ISLE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0046.flac,FOUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA SO CHANGED AS TO RENDER THE OLD CHARTS USELESS
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0047.flac,BUT EXTENDED AS FAR NORTH AS PORTO RICO AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE SEISMIC WAVE WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE ALTERED THE OCEAN BED ROUND JAMAICA
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0048.flac,SOUNDINGS SHOWED SEVEN FATHOMS WHERE BEFORE THE ERUPTION THERE WERE THIRTY SIX FATHOMS OF WATER
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0051.flac,IT SEEMED TO BE HOTTER THAN ORDINARY I SHED MY COAT AND VEST AND GOT INTO WHAT LITTLE SHADE THERE WAS AS I WORKED IT GREW HOTTER AND HOTTER I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0054.flac,I HAD ALL HANDS PIPED ON DECK AND WE BATTENED DOWN EVERYTHING LOOSE TO MAKE READY FOR A STORM
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0055.flac,THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SUN THAT AFTERNOON
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0059.flac,WELL THAT SORT OF THING WENT ON HOUR AFTER HOUR THE WAVES THE LIGHTNING THE HOT WATER AND THE SHARKS AND ALL THE REST OF THE ODD THINGS HAPPENING FRIGHTENED THE CREW OUT OF THEIR WITS
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0060.flac,MIGHTY STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN ON THE SEA BUT THIS TOPPED THEM ALL I KEPT TO THE BRIDGE ALL NIGHT
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0063.flac,CAREFUL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE FIERY STREAM WHICH SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED SAINT PIERRE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OF POISONOUS GASES
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0067.flac,WHICH AT ORDINARY TIMES ARE FOUND IN GREAT NUMBERS NEAR THE VOLCANO CRAWLED AWAY BIRDS CEASED SINGING AND LEFT THE TREES THAT SHADED THE SIDES OF PELEE
train-clean-360/5239/31629/5239-31629-0070.flac,THERE WERE BUT A FEW HUNDRED THOUGH LOCATED ON AN ELEVATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE CRATER IT WAS BY GREAT GOOD FORTUNE SAVED
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0002.flac,ENGLAND ITALY GREECE BACTRIA AND HINDOSTAN ON THE OTHER
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0003.flac,AND MEANS PRIMITIVE CHIEF AND MANCO
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0007.flac,IT REMINDS US OF MENES MINOS ET CETERA WHO ARE FOUND AT THE BEGINNING OF SO MANY OF THE OLD WORLD TRADITIONS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0009.flac,THE INCAS WERE SIMPLY AN OFFSHOOT WHO DESCENDING FROM THE MOUNTAINS SUBDUED THE RUDE RACES OF THE SEA COAST AND IMPOSED THEIR ANCIENT CIVILIZATION UPON THEM
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0012.flac,AN ARTIFICIAL HILL RAISED ON A GROUNDWORK OF STONE AND TWO STONE IDOLS APPARENTLY MADE BY SKILFUL ARTIFICERS TEN OR TWELVE FEET HIGH CLOTHED IN LONG ROBES
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0016.flac,PRISONS FURNACES FOR SMELTING METALS AND ALMOST EVERY CONCOMITANT OF CIVILIZATION EXISTED IN THE ANCIENT CHIMU CAPITAL
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0018.flac,THE NATIVE TRADITIONS SAID THIS CITY WAS BUILT BY BEARDED WHITE MEN WHO CAME THERE LONG BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS AND ESTABLISHED A SETTLEMENT
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0024.flac,THIS ROAD WAS MARVELLOUS NONE OF THE ROMAN ROADS I HAD SEEN IN ITALY IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE OR IN SPAIN APPEARED TO ME MORE IMPOSING THAN THIS WORK OF THE ANCIENT PERUVIANS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0027.flac,THEIR ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PRECIOUS METALS EXCEEDED ANYTHING PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0028.flac,IN A DESCRIPTION OF ONE LOT OF GOLDEN ARTICLES SENT TO SPAIN IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR BY PIZARRO THERE IS MENTION OF
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0032.flac,FOUR THE PRIEST EXAMINED THE ENTRAILS OF THE ANIMALS OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND LIKE THE ROMAN AUGURS DIVINED THE FUTURE FROM THEIR APPEARANCE
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0033.flac,SIX THEY DIVIDED THE YEAR INTO TWELVE MONTHS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0034.flac,EIGHT THEY POSSESSED CASTES AND THE TRADE OF THE FATHER DESCENDED TO THE SON AS IN INDIA NINE THEY HAD BARDS AND MINSTRELS WHO SUNG AT THE GREAT FESTIVALS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0038.flac,HE WAS THEN ALLOWED TO USE THE GIRDLE OR SASH AROUND THE LOINS CORRESPONDING TO THE TOGA VIRILIS OF THE ROMANS HE WAS THEN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0040.flac,OWL HEADED VASES TROY AND PERU
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0042.flac,THE DOORS WERE FRAMED OF GOLD
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0043.flac,THAT A STUDY OF ANCIENT PERUVIAN POTTERY HAS CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME OF FORMS WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR IN EGYPTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0044.flac,DOCTOR SCHLIEMANN IN HIS EXCAVATIONS OF THE RUINS OF TROY FOUND A NUMBER OF WHAT HE CALLS OWL HEADED IDOLS AND VASES
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0045.flac,IN PERU WE FIND VASES WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME STYLE OF FACE
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0050.flac,AND MANY AGAIN RESULT FROM THE CASUAL SPELLING OF THE SPANIARDS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0051.flac,HUAKIA TO CALL
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0052.flac,TO SPEAK HUASI A HOUSE VAS TO INHABIT
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0055.flac,I LOVE MUNANI I SHALL LOVE MUNASA AND THAT THE AFFIXES DENOTING CASES IN THE NOUN ARE CURIOUSLY LIKE THE GREEK PREPOSITIONS
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0056.flac,WILL HERE BE OBSERVED VERY RECENTLY DOCTOR RUDOLF FALB HAS ANNOUNCED
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0059.flac,SINCE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DOCTOR FALB DATED LEIPSIC APRIL FIFTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
train-clean-360/5239/32139/5239-32139-0061.flac,THE VERY TRADITIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED AS EXISTING AMONG THE PERUVIANS
train-clean-360/5242/35921/5242-35921-0004.flac,EXACTLY THIRTY NINE HAD ELECTED TO ATTEND CHURCH ON THIS PARTICULAR SUNDAY AND OF THESE THREE WERE FAST ASLEEP AND FOUR WERE DOZING
train-clean-360/5242/35921/5242-35921-0005.flac,FOR ANOTHER CLERGYMAN WAS PREACHING AND AS HE COUNTED BITTERNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOOK HOLD OF HIM THE PREACHER WAS A DEPUTATION
train-clean-360/5242/35921/5242-35921-0013.flac,IF INDEED THEY COULD BE SAID TO BOAST ANY GODS OTHER THAN THE SPEAR AND THE KING IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE HE NARRATED HIS TERRIBLE ADVENTURES AMONG THESE SAVAGES
train-clean-360/5242/35921/5242-35921-0014.flac,AND HIS OWN FLIGHT FOR HIS LIFE
train-clean-360/5242/35921/5242-35921-0044.flac,THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO UNDERTAKE THE MISSION MISTER OWEN SAID THE DEPUTATION BRISKLY FOR THE REFLECTION STUNG HIM UNINTENTIONAL AS IT WAS OWEN STARTED
train-clean-360/5242/35926/5242-35926-0014.flac,NOW THE FACE OF HAFELA GREW SULLEN AND WATCHING OWEN SAW A SWIFT CHANGE PASS OVER THAT OF HOKOSA EVIDENTLY HE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE WOMAN
train-clean-360/5242/35926/5242-35926-0019.flac,NAMED YOU AS HER WHO SHOULD BE HIS QUEEN WHEREON YOU WERE TAKEN AND PLACED IN THE HOUSE OF THE ROYAL WOMEN TO ABIDE THE DAY OF YOUR MARRIAGE WHICH SHOULD BE TO MORROW
train-clean-360/5242/35926/5242-35926-0046.flac,WHEN THE LAST OF THEM HAD DIED AWAY THE KING BROUGHT THE CUP TO THE LEVEL OF HIS LIPS OWEN SAW
train-clean-360/5242/35926/5242-35926-0047.flac,INDEED HIS ARM WAS LIFTED AND HIS MOUTH WAS OPEN
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0001.flac,BUT THE CITY FOLKS SEEMED GLUED TO THE FARM AND NO ONE OF THEM HAD YET APPEARED IN THE VILLAGE AS A MATTER OF FACT
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0012.flac,ETHEL THOMPSON HAD REFUSED TO ACCEPT ANY PAYMENT FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE BUT PEGGY BRAVELY CHARGED IT UP AT GOOD ROUND FIGURES WHEN THE BILL WAS MADE OUT AND FIGURED UP
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0017.flac,AND THE SHREWD ALERT LOOK THAT ACCOMPANIED IT EVEN MILLIONAIRES DO NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE SWINDLED IF THEY CAN HELP IT
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0018.flac,HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO KNOCK A FEW DOLLARS OFF FROM THAT MOST THINGS IS HIGH IN MILLVILLE HE FALTERED AN WAGES HAS GONE UP JEST TERR'BLE
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0019.flac,THAT IS THE CASE EVERYWHERE RESPONDED MISTER MERRICK THOUGHTFULLY AND BETWEEN US MC NUTT I'M GLAD WAGES ARE BETTER IN THESE PROSPEROUS TIMES
train-clean-360/5246/30101/5246-30101-0020.flac,FOR HE HAS TO PAY WELL FOR HIS LIVING ADEQUATELY PAID LABOR IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL PROSPERITY PEGGY SMILED CHEERFULLY

train-clean-360/5261/19373/5261-19373-0023.flac,A LATER STAGE STILL OCCURS WHEN THE THEORY HAS BEEN ACTUALLY AND COMPLETELY VERIFIED BY AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATION

train-clean-360/5261/19373/5261-19373-0068.flac,AND HE SAW THE PLANET THAT VERY NIGHT HE RECOGNIZED IT FIRST BY ITS APPEARANCE
train-clean-360/5261/19373/5261-19373-0069.flac,HE THEN CONSULTED BREMIKER'S GREAT STAR CHART THE PART JUST ENGRAVED AND FINISHED AND SURE ENOUGH ON THAT CHART THERE WAS NO SUCH STAR THERE UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS THE PLANET

train-clean-360/5266/34501/5266-34501-0019.flac,AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID LEVIN WOULD UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE WOULD GIVE HIM A KINDLY GOOD HUMORED REPULSE JUST NOW SINCE HIS DISENCHANTMENT WITH FARMING
train-clean-360/5266/34501/5266-34501-0022.flac,LABORERS WAGES AND SO ON WHICH HE WAS AWARE ARE CONVENTIONALLY REGARDED AS SOMETHING VERY LOW
train-clean-360/5266/34501/5266-34501-0024.flac,AND WHILE OUT SHOOTING WHEN HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF NOTHING AT ALL SUDDENLY THE OLD MAN AND HIS FAMILY KEPT COMING BACK TO HIS MIND AND THE IMPRESSION OF THEM SEEMED TO CLAIM NOT MERELY HIS ATTENTION

train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0002.flac,THIS IS ABSENT FROM SHAKESPEARE
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0003.flac,IN WHICH NOT ONLY THEY COULD NOT SPEAK BUT IN WHICH NO LIVING MAN EVER HAS SPOKEN OR DOES SPEAK
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0024.flac,EXISTS IN THE OLD DRAMA LEIR IS ANNOYED BY THE FAILURE OF HIS SCHEME AND THE POISONOUS WORDS OF HIS ELDEST DAUGHTERS IRRITATE HIM STILL MORE
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0025.flac,AFTER THE DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THE ELDER DAUGHTERS THERE FOLLOWS IN THE OLDER DRAMA A SCENE BETWEEN CORDELIA AND THE KING OF GAUL SETTING FORTH INSTEAD OF THE COLORLESS CORDELIA OF SHAKESPEARE
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0033.flac,BUT PERILLUS KENT ASSURES THE KING OF HIS LOVE TOWARD HIM AND LEIR PACIFIED GOES ON TO REGAN IN THE OLDER DRAMA THERE ARE NO TEMPESTS NOR TEARING OUT OF GRAY HAIRS
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0041.flac,TO THIS CORDELIA SAYS OH I KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THY DAUGHTER WILL LOVINGLY RECEIVE THEE HOW CANST THOU KNOW THIS WITHOUT KNOWING HER SAYS LEIR I KNOW SAYS CORDELIA

train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0049.flac,THE SAME ALSO WITH THE FAMOUS HAMLET THE SAME WITH ANTONY BRUTUS CLEOPATRA SHYLOCK RICHARD
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0075.flac,FOR THIS REASON ALONE DOES THIS FIGURE TRULY REPRESENT A DEFINITE CHARACTER
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0083.flac,THEREFORE HE SIMULATES INSANITY DESIRING TO BIDE HIS TIME AND OBSERVE ALL THAT GOES ON IN THE PALACE
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0086.flac,DESTROYS ALL THAT CONSTITUTES THE CHARACTER OF HAMLET AND OF THE LEGEND
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0088.flac,THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF FINDING ANY EXPLANATION WHATEVER OF HAMLET'S ACTIONS OR WORDS AND THEREFORE NO POSSIBILITY OF ATTRIBUTING ANY CHARACTER TO HIM
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0090.flac,EXISTING IN THIS PERSON HAVING NO CHARACTER AND THAT PRECISELY IN THIS ABSENCE OF CHARACTER CONSISTS THE GENIUS OF CREATING A DEEPLY CONCEIVED CHARACTER
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0095.flac,IF IN SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS ONE DOES MEET FIGURES HAVING CERTAIN CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES FOR THE MOST PART SECONDARY FIGURES SUCH AS POLONIUS IN HAMLET
train-clean-360/5337/37090/5337-37090-0097.flac,DO NOT AT ALL PROVE THAT THE MERIT OF SHAKESPEARE'S DRAMAS CONSISTS IN THE EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER

train-clean-360/534/127537/534-127537-0022.flac,THE RED CROSS WAS OF COURSE FAR TOO LARGE TO BE A GUIDE AND THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ON THE BACK AS YOU WILL HEAR
train-clean-360/534/127537/534-127537-0025.flac,ADJOINING ON THE NORTH THE SLOPING SOUTHERN SHOULDER OF THE SPY GLASS AND

train-clean-360/534/127537/534-127537-0046.flac,WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
train-clean-360/534/127538/534-127538-0000.flac,THERE ARE THREE TALL TREES SAID HE ABOUT IN THE RIGHT LINE FROM SKELETON ISLAND SPY GLASS SHOULDER I TAKE IT

train-clean-360/5386/28384/5386-28384-0002.flac,AS THEY ARE COMMONLY CAREFUL TO IMPROVE THEIR MINDS BY READING AND INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION THEY HAVE NO SMALL SHARE OF FACETIOUSNESS AND INGENUITY
train-clean-360/5386/28384/5386-28384-0025.flac,MARRIAGES AMONG THE JEWS SAY THE RABBIES WERE AGREED ON BY THE PARENTS AND RELATIONS OF BOTH SIDES WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE BRIDEGROOM WAS INTRODUCED TO HIS BRIDE PRESENTS WERE MUTUALLY EXCHANGED
train-clean-360/5386/28384/5386-28384-0038.flac,THIS WAS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF MARRYING AMONG THE ROMANS IT CONTINUED IN USE EVEN AFTER THEY BECAME CHRISTIANS
train-clean-360/5386/28384/5386-28384-0040.flac,IN THIS CASE IF THEY MADE UP THE MATTER BETWEEN THEMSELVES IT BECAME A VALID MARRIAGE AND THE CHILDREN WERE CONSIDERED AS LEGITIMATE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS IS THE PRESENT CUSTOM IN SCOTLAND
train-clean-360/5386/28384/5386-28384-0041.flac,THE CASE IS THE SAME IN HOLLAND AND SOME PARTS OF GERMANY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0000.flac,HERE WE SEE GOD DEALING IN SLAVES GIVING THEM TO HIS OWN FAVOURITE CHILD ABRAHAM A MAN OF SUPERLATIVE WORTH AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS EMINENT GOODNESS
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0015.flac,HAVE WE LESS PRECIOUS PROMISES IN THE SCRIPTURES OF TRUTH MAY WE NOT CLAIM OF OUR GOD THE BLESSING PROMISED UNTO THOSE WHO CONSIDER THE POOR
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0017.flac,CONTINUE IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION THAT GOD WILL GRANT US THE SUPPLIES OF HIS SPIRIT
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0023.flac,THAN TO SATISFY HIM THAT THE SCRIPTURES FAVOURED SUCH A SYSTEM OF SIN DON'T YOU SUPPOSE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES BETTER THAN YOU
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0024.flac,YES ANSWERED HE I DID NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THEN
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0025.flac,I DON'T THINK THAT THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY
train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0027.flac,WHEN ALSO THE NEW TESTAMENT EXHIBITS SUCH WORDS OF REBUKE AS THESE BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABOURERS WHO HAVE REAPED DOWN YOUR FIELDS WHICH IS OF YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD CRIETH

train-clean-360/5386/4145/5386-4145-0037.flac,AND NO ONE WAS MORE ABLE THAN HERSELF TO IMPRESS THOSE VIEWS UPON THE HEARTS OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE CAME IN CONTACT
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0002.flac,AND MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0004.flac,THAT YOU SHALL HAVE REPLIED THE MAN BUT TO MORROW I SHALL GIVE YOU SOME WORK TO DO FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I AM THE CHIEF HERDSMAN OF THE KING THE YOUTH MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS

train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0007.flac,ASKED THE OLD MAN IN SURPRISE WHEN HIS SON KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HUT HE HAD LEFT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE THEY BELONG TO THE KING'S CHIEF HERDSMAN ANSWERED HIS SON
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0008.flac,NOW MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND KILL THEM AND HANG THEM UP AT ONCE
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0010.flac,THEN HE CUT OFF THE TAILS AND TIED THEM TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF CORD AND SWINGING THE BUNDLE OVER HIS BACK HE RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0014.flac,LEAVING ONLY THE POINTS OF THEIR TAILS WHICH YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF YOU HAVE MADE UP THAT STORY VERY WELL REPLIED THE HERDSMAN
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0015.flac,AND THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE SPOT
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0023.flac,WHEN ALL WAS DONE TO HIS LIKING HE HASTENED QUICKLY BACK TO HIS MASTER WHERE ARE THE SHEEP

train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0028.flac,STILL THE SOUND OF SHEEP BELLS RANG SOFTLY FROM ABOVE AND THE HERDSMAN KNEW THEM TO BE THOSE HE HAD HUNG ON THE HORNS OF HIS RAM DO YOU HEAR ASKED THE YOUTH YES I HEAR

train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0031.flac,BUT THE SON ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID NO NO
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0034.flac,THEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING RAN HOME TO HIS MASTER
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0035.flac,IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD SOUNDS OF BELLOWING AND I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF THE GOLDEN HORNED OX BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE SOUNDS HAD COME I COULD NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING IN THE HOLE ITSELF
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0037.flac,I HAVE THOUGHT OF EXACTLY THE THING FOR YOU SAID THE HERDSMAN AS THEY WALKED ALONG AND IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE A MISTAKE
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0038.flac,FOR I WANT THE GRASS MOWN IN ONE OF MY MEADOWS TO MORROW AT THESE WORDS THE YOUTH'S HEART SANK FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED EITHER AS A SMITH OR A JOINER
train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0039.flac,SLOWLY AND SADLY HE WENT TO BED BUT HE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING HOW THE SCYTHES WERE TO BE MADE

train-clean-360/5386/8684/5386-8684-0046.flac,AND HE THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO WAS SO CLEVER WAS JUST THE MAN TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY
train-clean-360/5389/41911/5389-41911-0008.flac,FOR THERE DWELL THREE OF MY BROTHERS

train-clean-360/5389/4861/5389-4861-0008.flac,THEN THE WHOLE THING DAWNED ON THE KING AND GROANING DEEPLY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
train-clean-360/5389/4861/5389-4861-0012.flac,AND FOUND HIMSELF QUITE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK WOOD
train-clean-360/5389/4861/5389-4861-0029.flac,WASN'T THE LEAST AFRAID AND APPROACHED THE THRONE STILL ON HIS KNEES AT LAST THE MAGICIAN LAUGHED ALOUD AND SAID

train-clean-360/5660/101892/5660-101892-0012.flac,THERE WAS A FEVERISHNESS IN MARGARET'S MANNER AND A TREMULOUSNESS IN HER VOICE
train-clean-360/5660/101892/5660-101892-0015.flac,WHAT MORE COULD YOU DO VENTURED THE MAN MARGARET ROSE AND MOVED RESTLESSLY AROUND THE ROOM I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID AT LAST

train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0003.flac,THE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED CONDITION OF OTHERS AND THE LOW MENTAL POWERS OF ALL THAT SUCH COLOURS DO NOT SERVE AS A SEXUAL ATTRACTION AND HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION
train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0004.flac,EXCEPT WHERE ONE SEX IS MUCH MORE BRILLIANTLY OR CONSPICUOUSLY COLOURED THAN THE OTHER AND WHERE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN HABITS BETWEEN THE SEXES SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DIFFERENT COLOURS
train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0006.flac,AND IF IT BE ADVANTAGEOUS SEXUAL SELECTION WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY FOLLOW WE MAY HOWEVER EXTEND THIS CONCLUSION TO BOTH SEXES WHEN COLOURED ALIKE

train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0020.flac,DO NOT SEEK CONCEALMENT WHILST AGAIN SOME EQUALLY CONSPICUOUS SPECIES AS WELL AS OTHER DULL COLOURED KINDS LIVE UNDER STONES AND IN DARK RECESSES

train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0030.flac,AND THESE ARE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS IN THE MALES THAN IN THE FEMALES AS THE MALES WITHOUT ANY UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OLFACTORY ORGANS
train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0031.flac,THE INCREASED NUMBER OF THE SMELLING THREADS HAS PROBABLY BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION BY THE BETTER PROVIDED MALES HAVING BEEN THE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING PARTNERS AND IN PRODUCING OFFSPRING
train-clean-360/5684/46240/5684-46240-0032.flac,IN WHICH THE MALE IS REPRESENTED BY TWO DISTINCT FORMS

train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0006.flac,AND IT MAY BE ASKED ARE THEIR COLOURS AND DIVERSIFIED PATTERNS THE RESULT OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS TO WHICH THESE INSECTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0007.flac,OR HAVE SUCCESSIVE VARIATIONS BEEN ACCUMULATED AND DETERMINED AS A PROTECTION OR FOR SOME UNKNOWN PURPOSE OR THAT ONE SEX MAY BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE OTHER
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0008.flac,AND ALIKE IN THE TWO SEXES OF OTHER SPECIES OF THE SAME GENUS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS A BODY OF FACTS MUST BE GIVEN
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0013.flac,AND DIFFER MUCH FROM THEIR FEMALES THE FEMALES THROUGHOUT THE GENUS RETAIN THE SAME GENERAL STYLE OF COLOURING SO THAT THEY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN THEY RESEMBLE THEIR OWN MALES
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0015.flac,IN OTHERS THE MALES ARE EITHER A LITTLE BRIGHTER OR VERY MUCH MORE SUPERB THAN THE FEMALES
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0016.flac,FOR ALTHOUGH THE SEXES OF MOST OF THE SPECIES RESEMBLE EACH OTHER
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0017.flac,THE MALE IS RATHER MORE BRIGHT COLOURED THAN THE FEMALE

train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0022.flac,AND ARE VERY LIKE THOUGH IN THE FEMALE THE EDGES OF THE WINGS ARE RATHER DUSKIER WITH THE BLACK SPOTS PLAINER AND IN A BRIGHT BLUE INDIAN SPECIES BOTH SEXES ARE STILL MORE ALIKE
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0024.flac,IN SOME CASES HOWEVER TO WHICH I SHALL HEREAFTER ALLUDE THE FEMALES ARE COLOURED MORE SPLENDIDLY THAN THE MALES IN THE SECOND PLACE THESE DETAILS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO BRING CLEARLY BEFORE THE MIND
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0026.flac,OR TO THE MALE HAVING RETAINED OR PERHAPS RECOVERED
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0027.flac,IT ALSO DESERVES NOTICE THAT IN THOSE GROUPS IN WHICH THE SEXES DIFFER THE FEMALES USUALLY SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE THE MALES SO THAT WHEN THE MALES ARE BEAUTIFUL TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0028.flac,ARE THE PURPOSELESS RESULT OF THE NATURE OF THE TISSUES AND OF THE ACTION OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0032.flac,IN THESE SPECIES BOTH SEXES ARE ALIKE BUT IN THE COMMON BRIMSTONE BUTTERFLY GONEPTERYX RHAMNI THE MALE IS OF AN INTENSE YELLOW WHILST THE FEMALE IS MUCH PALER
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0034.flac,BUT THEN WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE IMITATED SPECIES AS MISTER WALSH HAS REMARKED TO ME THE FEMALES OF OUR ORANGE TIP BUTTERFLY ABOVE REFERRED TO
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0035.flac,FOR BOTH SEXES OF FOUR OR FIVE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED SPECIES ARE COLOURED IN NEARLY THE SAME MANNER AS IN SEVERAL PREVIOUS CASES WE MAY HERE INFER
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0036.flac,WHICH HAVE DEPARTED FROM THE USUAL TYPE OF THE GENUS
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0037.flac,THE ORANGE TIPS TO THE WINGS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY DEVELOPED IN THE FEMALE BUT THEY ARE PALER THAN IN THE MALE

train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0039.flac,BUT THE FOLLOWING FACT SHEWS HOW CAUTIOUS WE OUGHT TO BE IN DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON THIS HEAD THE COMMON YELLOW UNDER WINGS TRIPHAENA OFTEN FLY ABOUT DURING THE DAY OR EARLY EVENING

train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0044.flac,YET IN MANY SPECIES IT IS AS HIGHLY DECORATED AS THE UPPER SURFACE
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0047.flac,OTHER SUCH CASES COULD BE ADDED IF WE NOW TURN TO THE ENORMOUS GROUP OF MOTHS WHICH AS I HEAR FROM MISTER STAINTON
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0050.flac,THEIR WINGS BEING DECORATED AS IN OUR BRITISH EMPEROR MOTH
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0052.flac,FROM THE SEVERAL FOREGOING FACTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIT THAT THE BRILLIANT COLOURS OF BUTTERFLIES AND OF SOME FEW MOTHS HAVE COMMONLY BEEN ACQUIRED FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTION
train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0054.flac,AND THAT ANTS RECOGNISE THEIR FELLOWS AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SEVERAL MONTHS HENCE THERE IS NO ABSTRACT IMPROBABILITY IN THE LEPIDOPTERA WHICH PROBABLY STAND NEARLY OR QUITE AS HIGH IN THE SCALE AS THESE INSECTS

train-clean-360/5684/46243/5684-46243-0058.flac,AS I HEAR FROM MISTER DOUBLEDAY THE COMMON WHITE BUTTERFLY OFTEN FLIES DOWN TO A BIT OF PAPER ON THE GROUND

train-clean-360/5712/48848/5712-48848-0041.flac,BUT BELL WAS NOT SEATED NEXT TO HER LOVER
train-clean-360/5712/48848/5712-48848-0046.flac,THERE WAS THEREFORE A QUESTION OF BUYING NEW FURNITURE FOR A HOUSE IN GUESTWICK
train-clean-360/5712/48848/5712-48848-0047.flac,IN THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO THEY WERE TO LIVE IN LODGINGS AND THEIR GOODS WERE TO BE STORED IN SOME FRIENDLY WAREHOUSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT NOT BE WELL
train-clean-360/5712/48848/5712-48848-0052.flac,NO YOU MAY NOT AS IF I HADN'T KNOWN IT ALL ALONG AND WASN'T IT HARD TO BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SCOLDED ME WITH SUCH PERTINACIOUS AUSTERITY
train-clean-360/5717/100145/5717-100145-0001.flac,I TAKE IT THAT IT IS THE UNANIMOUS WILL OF THIS CONVOCATION THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE GALACTIC EMPEROR BE ACKNOWLEDGED
train-clean-360/5717/100145/5717-100145-0003.flac,TO INFORM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF HIS NEW SOVEREIGN OF THE FACT PRINCE TREVANNION IN THE NAME OF THE EMPEROR DELIVERED THE WELL WORN WORDS OF WELCOME AND

train-clean-360/5746/48361/5746-48361-0011.flac,AND THAT CAESAR WAS THE ONLY REFUGE HE HAD LEFT TO PREVENT BOTH HIS AND HER DELIVERY INTO HIS FATHER'S HANDS THEN DID ANTIPATER FALL DOWN AT HIS FATHER'S FEET AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO PREJUDGE HIS CAUSE
train-clean-360/5746/48361/5746-48361-0012.flac,SO HEROD ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST AND THEN LAMENTED HIMSELF ABOUT HIS CHILDREN FROM WHOM HE HAD SUFFERED SUCH GREAT MISFORTUNES AND BECAUSE ANTIPATER FELL UPON HIM IN HIS OLD AGE
train-clean-360/5746/48361/5746-48361-0015.flac,AND THAT HE WONDERED WHAT HOPES COULD ELEVATE ANTIPATER TO SUCH A PASS AS TO BE HARDY ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT SUCH THINGS

train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0041.flac,SOME TEN OR A DOZEN HEADS PEERED CURIOUSLY AT US OVER HER WEATHER BULWARKS AS SHE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0042.flac,SEIZED A TRUMPET TO HAIL US BUT WHETHER HE DID SO OR NOT OR IF HE DID WHAT HE SAID
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0043.flac,ONCE MORE INTO THE TROUGH WITH A PERFECT MOUNTAIN OF WATER BETWEEN US
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0044.flac,OPEN AND ADJUSTED READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0045.flac,AND THE FIRST THING WHICH CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS HER NAME PAINTED ON HER STERN WHICH WAS NOW TOWARDS US
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0049.flac,I AM AS SURPRISED AS I AM DELIGHTED AT HER BEHAVIOUR I COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED WITHOUT SEEING IT MYSELF THAT SO SMALL A CRAFT WOULD EVEN LIVE IN SUCH WEATHER
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0050.flac,SHAKING HER FEATHERS LIKE A DUCK I'M AFRAID
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0051.flac,NEVER FEAR RETURNED BOB CONFIDENTLY OUR BIT OF A WINDLASS AND THE MAST BREAKS THE FORCE OF IT BEFORE IT REACHES THE SKYLIGHT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0052.flac,ALMOST LIKE THE STEM OF A SHIP BESIDES BEIN STRONGER THAN A SQUARE SHAPED CONSARN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0053.flac,BUT HOW'S IT TO BE PERVENTED I HAVE AN IDEA SAID I AND IT'S WORTH A TRIAL
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0054.flac,SO SAYING I DIVED BELOW AND GOT OUT A BOTTLE OF OIL
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0055.flac,OR FOUR HOLES WITH A CORKSCREW BUT LEFT THE CORK IN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0057.flac,AND AS HE DID SO I HOVE THE BOTTLE OVERBOARD
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0058.flac,EITHER WITHOUT BREAKING AT ALL OR IF THEY DID BREAK IT WAS WITH SUCH DIMINISHED FORCE THAT NO MORE WATER CAME ON BOARD I HAD HEARD
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0059.flac,SO THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL A TEST
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0060.flac,UNDER WEIGH AND WHILST DISCUSSING THE MEAL OUR CONVERSATION NATURALLY TURNED UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE ALBATROSS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION I FEAR
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0061.flac,JOHNSON AND HIS GANG OF DESPERADOES SAID I
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0062.flac,BUT HE WAS QUITE OF MY OPINION NO NO SAID HE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0063.flac,I NOTICED THE NAME ON HIS STARN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0064.flac,FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAILS FROM NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR BESIDES A MAN WITH HALF AN EYE COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT THAT CRAFT THAT SHE'S STRONG HANDED
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0065.flac,AND WORST LUCK SHE'S BOUND THE SAME ROAD AS OURSELVES
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0066.flac,OTHER COMING DOWN THE COAST FOR IF WE FALLS IN WITH HER AG'IN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0067.flac,AS OURSELVES A THOUGHT DO YOU THAT'S JUST WHAT HE'S
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0068.flac,HE IS NOT FOOL ENOUGH TO SUPPOSE WE'RE DOWN HERE SOMEWHERES OFF THE HORN IN THIS COCKLE SHELL ON A PLEASURE TRIP AND THAT WE'RE NOT COME DOWN HERE TO TRADE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0069.flac,OR WE SHOULD HAVE A CRAFT BIG ENOUGH TO STOW AWAY SOMETHING LIKE A PAYING CARGO AND IF WE'RE HERE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0070.flac,HE'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR AND DEPEND UPON IT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0071.flac,AND IF WE FALL IN WITH HIM AGAIN LET'S GIVE HIM A WIDE BERTH
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0072.flac,BUT GIVE US WEATHER IN WHICH WE CAN CARRY A TOPSAIL EVEN IF IT'S NO
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0074.flac,BRIGHT LOOK OUT AND NOT BE CAUGHT NAPPING THAT'S ALL AND GIVE EVERYTHING A GOOD WIDE BERTH
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0075.flac,I TRUST WE SHALL NOT FALL IN WITH HIM AGAIN THE PACIFIC IS A PRETTY BIG PLACE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0078.flac,OF BOB'S BUT IT WAS SATISFACTORY TO FIND THAT HE HAD SUCH GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE BOAT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0079.flac,ESPECIALLY AS IT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM CONSIDERABLE ENTERTAINMENT AND WENT ON DECK TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WEATHER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE GALE BREAKING IN FACT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0080.flac,AND THE SEA WAS SOMETHING AWFUL TO CONTEMPLATE IT LOOKED OF COURSE WORSE TO US THAN IT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0083.flac,OF MORTALS AND I AM CONFIDENT OF THIS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0085.flac,REARING ITSELF BETWEEN MY EYE AND THE HORIZON SO FAR THE WATER LILY HAD WEATHERED THE GALE SCATHELESS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0087.flac,FOR ON DECK EVERYTHING WAS COLD WET AND DISMAL IN THE EXTREME I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET A SIGHT OF THE SUN AT NOON IF POSSIBLE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0088.flac,TO THE SOUTHWARD OF STATEN AND I
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0090.flac,TOWARDS EVENING THEREFORE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0092.flac,AND ACCORDINGLY GOT OUT ANOTHER AND HAVING BORED HOLES IN THE CORK
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0094.flac,DREADFULLY TEDIOUS COOPED UP AS WE WERE IN OUR LOW CABIN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0095.flac,A MOST WELCOME BREAK IN THE MONOTONY WE SAT LONG OVER THIS ONE THEREFORE PROLONGING IT TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0097.flac,THAN HE PULLED IT IN AGAIN EXCLAIMING IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE LOOK HERE HARRY WHAT D'YE THINK OF THIS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0098.flac,WAS A GLOBE OF PALE SICKLY GREEN LIGHT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0099.flac,TOSSED WILDLY OVER THE MOUNTAINOUS SEAS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0100.flac,BRILLIANT AT THE CORE AND SOFTENING OFF AND BECOMING MORE DIM AS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE GLOBE WAS REACHED
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0102.flac,WHAT D'YE THINK OF BEIN BOARDED BY THE LIKES OF THAT AGAIN QUERIED BOB IN A HOARSE WHISPER OLD DAVY IS OUT ON A CRUISE TO NIGHT I RECKON
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0104.flac,AT THE MOMENT THAT BOB SPOKE BUT WERE NOW SETTLING INTO THE TROUGH AS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0105.flac,SHE WAS FEARFULLY CLOSE BUT APPEARED TO BE AT THE MOMENT SHEERING AWAY FROM US SHE LOOKED LONG ENOUGH
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0106.flac,OR WHAT I THOUGHT MORE PROBABLE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0107.flac,AS IT WERE UNTIL IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE FOLLOWING WAVE WOULD RUN CLEAN OVER HER BUT GRADUALLY
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0108.flac,WHILST HER BOW IN ITS TURN SEEMED WEIGHED DOWN
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0109.flac,BUT POOR CHAPS IT'S LITTLE OF THAT WE CAN GIVE EM
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0111.flac,IN ONE VAST VOLUME OF WILDLY FLASHING FOAM
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0112.flac,GAZED IN SPEECHLESS HORROR AT THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE A LOUD PIERCING SHRIEK RANG OUT CLEAR
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0113.flac,SHE ROLLED COMPLETELY BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED BROACHED TO AND CAPSIZED EJACULATED WE BOTH IN THE SAME BREATH
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0114.flac,COLLECT MY SCATTERED FACULTIES IN AN INSTANT I HAD ALL FOUR OF THE BUOYS READY
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0117.flac,IN THE HOPE OF SEEING SOME POOR SOUL
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0119.flac,DEPEND ON'T HARRY QUOTH HE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0120.flac,BUT YOU SEE THEY DID MEAN MISCHIEF AND PLENTY OF IT TOO
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0121.flac,I MAKE NO MANNER OF DOUBT IT WAS UTTERLY IN VAIN THAT I ATTEMPTED TO ARGUE THE HONEST FELLOW OUT OF HIS BELIEF
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0122.flac,FOR HIS MIND WAS DEEPLY IMBUED WITH ALL THOSE SUPERSTITIOUS NOTIONS WHICH APPEAR TO TAKE SUCH PECULIARLY FIRM HOLD ON THE IDEAS OF SAILORS
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0124.flac,WE FOUND THAT THE GALE WAS BREAKING ALSO BY THE TIME THAT BREAKFAST WAS OVER THERE WAS A SENSIBLE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE WIND
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0125.flac,NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE CERTAINLY THE SEA WAS RUNNING FAR TOO HIGH FOR THAT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0126.flac,SIXTY MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD OF STATEN ABOUT FOUR P M
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0127.flac,BY IT THAT OUR DRIFT HAD NOT BEEN ANYTHING LIKE SO GREAT AS I HAD CALCULATED IT WOULD BE
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0128.flac,SETTING CURRENT THERE WAS STILL RATHER TOO MUCH OF BOTH WIND AND SEA TO MAKE US DISPOSED TO GET UNDER WAY THAT NIGHT
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0129.flac,TO THE BUOY OF OUR FLOATING ANCHOR WHICH WE WEIGHED AND
train-clean-360/5776/46889/5776-46889-0130.flac,AND TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH WE SUSPECTED
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0000.flac,THIS BELIEF WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS GROUNDS THE PREPARATIONS OF BOTH THE COMBATANTS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0011.flac,AND WERE INVITED AS ALLIES INTO THE OTHER CITIES THAT ONE BY ONE THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED FROM THE CONNECTION THE NAME OF HELLENES
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0013.flac,IN HIS POEMS THEY ARE CALLED DANAANS ARGIVES AND ACHAEANS HE DOES NOT EVEN USE THE TERM BARBARIAN
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0017.flac,AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0018.flac,AND EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY MANY OF HELLAS STILL FOLLOW THE OLD FASHION THE OZOLIAN
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0021.flac,A FASHION WHICH SPREAD TO THEIR IONIAN KINDRED AND LONG PREVAILED AMONG THE OLD MEN THERE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0030.flac,AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0031.flac,WHAT ENABLED AGAMEMNON TO RAISE THE ARMAMENT WAS MORE IN MY OPINION HIS SUPERIORITY IN STRENGTH THAN THE OATHS OF TYNDAREUS WHICH BOUND THE SUITORS TO FOLLOW HIM
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0032.flac,INDEED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THOSE PELOPONNESIANS WHO HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENTS OF THE MOST CREDIBLE TRADITION IS THIS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0034.flac,AND TO THE HANDS OF HIS RELATION WHO HAD LEFT HIS FATHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF CHRYSIPPUS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0035.flac,WHEN HE SET OUT ON HIS EXPEDITION HAD COMMITTED MYCENAE AND THE GOVERNMENT AS TIME WENT ON AND EURYSTHEUS DID NOT RETURN
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0036.flac,BESIDES HIS POWER SEEMED CONSIDERABLE AND HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED TO COURT THE FAVOUR OF THE POPULACE AND ASSUMED THE SCEPTRE OF MYCENAE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0037.flac,AND SO THE POWER OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PELOPS CAME TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0038.flac,AND THAT OF THE ARCADIANS WAS FURNISHED BY HIM THIS AT LEAST IS WHAT HOMER SAYS IF HIS TESTIMONY IS DEEMED SUFFICIENT BESIDES IN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SCEPTRE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0043.flac,WHEREAS IF ATHENS WERE TO SUFFER THE SAME MISFORTUNE I SUPPOSE THAT ANY INFERENCE FROM THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THE EYE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0045.flac,HE HAS REPRESENTED IT AS CONSISTING OF TWELVE HUNDRED VESSELS THE BOEOTIAN COMPLEMENT OF EACH SHIP BEING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0050.flac,THEY WOULD HAVE EASILY DEFEATED THE TROJANS IN THE FIELD SINCE THEY COULD HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST THEM WITH THE DIVISION ON SERVICE IN SHORT IF THEY HAD STUCK TO THE SIEGE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0055.flac,THE REVENUES OF THE STATES INCREASING TYRANNIES WERE BY THEIR MEANS ESTABLISHED ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT BEING HEREDITARY MONARCHY WITH DEFINITE PREROGATIVES
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0057.flac,AND WE HAVE AMEINOCLES A CORINTHIAN SHIPWRIGHT MAKING FOUR SHIPS FOR THE SAMIANS DATING FROM THE END OF THIS WAR IT IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0058.flac,AGAIN THE EARLIEST SEA FIGHT IN HISTORY WAS BETWEEN THE CORINTHIANS AND CORCYRAEANS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0061.flac,TO PROCURE HER NAVY AND PUT DOWN PIRACY AND AS SHE COULD OFFER A MART FOR BOTH BRANCHES OF THE TRADE SHE ACQUIRED FOR HERSELF ALL THE POWER WHICH A LARGE REVENUE AFFORDS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0062.flac,SUBSEQUENTLY THE IONIANS ATTAINED TO GREAT NAVAL STRENGTH IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE FIRST KING OF THE PERSIANS AND OF HIS SON CAMBYSES
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0063.flac,SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRINCIPALLY COMPOSED OF THE OLD FIFTY OARS AND LONG BOATS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0068.flac,OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0074.flac,OR WITH ITS OWN REVOLTED ALLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED THEM CONSTANT PRACTICE IN MILITARY MATTERS AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS LEARNT IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0077.flac,PISISTRATUS WAS REALLY SUPREME
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0078.flac,YET NOT LIKING TO BE APPREHENDED AND RISK THEIR LIVES FOR NOTHING FELL UPON HIPPARCHUS NEAR THE TEMPLE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF LEOS
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0079.flac,WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN OBSCURED BY TIME FOR INSTANCE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0080.flac,KINGS HAVE TWO VOTES EACH THE FACT BEING THAT THEY HAVE ONLY ONE
train-clean-360/580/126945/580-126945-0082.flac,TO COME TO THIS WAR DESPITE THE KNOWN DISPOSITION OF THE ACTORS IN A STRUGGLE TO OVERRATE ITS IMPORTANCE
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0011.flac,FOR THE TRUE AUTHOR OF THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE IS NOT SO MUCH THE IMMEDIATE AGENT
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0013.flac,HAVE CAST THREATS ASIDE AND BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO ACTION AND WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE PATHS BY WHICH ATHENIAN AGGRESSION TRAVELS
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0018.flac,AGAINST ATHENS YOU PREFER TO ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF ON THE OFFENSIVE
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0028.flac,AND THOUGH FIXED USAGES MAY BE BEST FOR UNDISTURBED COMMUNITIES CONSTANT NECESSITIES OF ACTION MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0031.flac,SUCH WERE THE WORDS OF THE CORINTHIANS
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0032.flac,ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0033.flac,THAT IT WAS NOT A MATTER TO BE HASTILY DECIDED ON BUT ONE THAT DEMANDED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
train-clean-360/580/126947/580-126947-0034.flac,AND TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF THE OLD AND ENLIGHTEN THE IGNORANCE OF THE YOUNG FROM A NOTION THAT THEIR WORDS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF INDUCING THEM TO PREFER TRANQUILLITY TO WAR

train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0003.flac,THAT IT CONTAINS THE GERM OF PERPETUAL MOTION I WILL CONSIDER YOUR SUGGESTION REPLIED THE IDIOT MEANWHILE LET US CONSULT HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER ON THE ORIGINAL POINT
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0005.flac,AND AS FOR THE MUSIC CURE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HAVEN'T HEARD EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT IT AND
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0006.flac,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MUSIC CURE
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0007.flac,EXPLAINED THE IDIOT THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT IN MUSIC LIES THE PANACEA FOR ALL HUMAN ILLS
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0009.flac,I HAVE SEEN A REFERENCE TO IT SOMEWHERE
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0011.flac,I AM SURPRISED THAT DOCTOR CAPSULE HAS NEITHER HEARD NOR THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD PROVE TO BE A PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE FIELD FOR SPECULATION
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0016.flac,TWO WEEKS LATER I WENT AGAIN THIS TIME TO HEAR
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0017.flac,THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME ONLY THE EFFECT WAS INSTANTANEOUS
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0018.flac,AND DOZED OFF INTO A FATHOMLESS SLEEP I DIDN'T WAKE UP THIS TIME UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY THE REST OF THE PARTY HAVING GONE OFF WITHOUT AWAKENING ME AS A SORT OF JOKE
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0019.flac,THEN DESERVES TO RANK AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE NARCOTICS KNOWN TO MODERN SCIENCE
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0020.flac,THAT TWO DOSES OF WAGNER BROUGHT ABOUT IN ONE INSTANT AND BEST OF ALL THERE WAS NO REACTION NO SPLITTING HEADACHE OR SHAKY HAND THE NEXT DAY
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0022.flac,IN ADDITION TO THIS EXPERIENCE
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0023.flac,HE HAD SPENT THE DAY DOWN AT ASBURY PARK AND HAD EATEN NOT WISELY BUT TOO COPIOUSLY
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0024.flac,A GLASS OF FRESH CIDER AND A SAUCERFUL OF PISTACHE ICE CREAM
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0025.flac,HE WAS NOT FITTED BY TEMPERAMENT TO ASSIMILATE ANYTHING QUITE SO STRENUOUSLY CHROMATIC AS THAT
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0027.flac,AND THEN JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HIMSELF UP FOR LOST AN AMATEUR CORNETIST WHO OCCUPIED A STUDIO ON THE FLOOR ABOVE BEGAN TO PLAY THE LOST CHORD A COUNTER PAIN SET IN IMMEDIATELY
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0028.flac,AND PHYSICAL RELIEF WAS INSTANT
train-clean-360/5802/66347/5802-66347-0029.flac,SNEERED THE DOCTOR IT WOULD SEEM SO SAID THE IDIOT WHILE THE MUSIC CONTINUED MY FRIEND WAS A WELL MAN READY TO GO OUT AND FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR

train-clean-360/5802/76044/5802-76044-0004.flac,WHAT YOU GET IS A QUITE OPEN AND RECOGNIZED DISCORD OF TWO SETS OF MOTIVES THE DOCTOR CONSIDERED
train-clean-360/5802/76044/5802-76044-0009.flac,I STOOD WITH MY FEET UPON THE STONE AGE AND SAW MYSELF FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AWAY AND ALL MY DISTRESSES AS VERY LITTLE INCIDENTS IN THAT PERSPECTIVE AWAY THERE IN LONDON THE CASE IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT
train-clean-360/5802/76044/5802-76044-0014.flac,A GREAT PHRASE BUT THE DUST CHOKES ME SAID SIR RICHMOND HE TOOK UP A COPY OF THE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND THAT LAY BESIDE HIM ON THE TABLE BUT HE DID NOT OPEN IT
train-clean-360/5802/76044/5802-76044-0020.flac,THEY WERE IMPEDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE KEEPER OF THE TURNSTILE AND A SMALL BUT RESOLUTE BOY OF PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX WHO PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE ENCLOSURE

train-clean-360/5809/51162/5809-51162-0014.flac,AND SOON THE OLD WOMAN WAS ONCE MORE GLIDING SMOOTHLY OVER THE QUIET WATER TOWARD ANTWERP WHEN FATHER DE SMET CAME BACK TO THE STERN OF THE BOAT
train-clean-360/5809/51162/5809-51162-0015.flac,BUT PERHAPS IT SEEMED TO THE GOOD NATURED SKIPPER
train-clean-360/5809/51162/5809-51162-0017.flac,THAT IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH DREADFUL THINGS WERE GOING ON ALL ABOUT THEM

train-clean-360/5809/51163/5809-51163-0001.flac,AS A MULE HE FINISHED HELPLESSLY JOSEPH LAUGHED CAN'T YOU THINK OF ANYTHING MULISHER THAN A MULE HE SAID THERE ISN'T A THING
train-clean-360/5809/51163/5809-51163-0002.flac,I DON'T SEE WHY THEY WERE EVER BORN FATHER DE SMET BECAME SERIOUS AT ONCE SON HE SAID STERNLY
train-clean-360/5809/51163/5809-51163-0011.flac,SHE AND JAN BROUGHT OUT THE ONIONS AND A PAN AND SOON THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SMELL OF FRYING ONIONS JOSEPH AND JAN SLIPPED THE BRIDLE OVER NETTEKE'S COLLAR
train-clean-360/5809/51163/5809-51163-0012.flac,WHEN FATHER DE SMET RETURNED SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY HE SNIFFED APPRECIATIVELY AS HE APPEARED UNDER THE TREES SMELLS GOOD HE SAID
train-clean-360/5809/51163/5809-51163-0031.flac,THEY MEANT TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BY PROLONGING MY MISERY AND THEY LINGERED JUST A BIT TOO LONG

train-clean-360/5809/58763/5809-58763-0018.flac,IT WILL REQUIRE A GREATER AMOUNT OF DEPRESSION OF TEMPERATURE TO CAUSE CONDENSATION AND THIS IS WHY WE USUALLY HAVE HEAVIER DEWS IN JUNE WHEN THE AIR IS MORE HIGHLY CHARGED WITH MOISTURE
train-clean-360/5809/58763/5809-58763-0021.flac,THERE WILL BE A COLD STRATUM OF AIR NEXT TO THE EARTH
train-clean-360/5809/58763/5809-58763-0023.flac,AND IN THE LATTER CASE THERE IS A CONSTANT CHANGE OF AIR SO THAT IN EITHER CASE NO PART OF IT IS ALLOWED TO COOL DOWN SUFFICIENTLY TO PRECIPITATE MOISTURE
train-clean-360/5809/58763/5809-58763-0025.flac,IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEAD CINDER FLOATING IN SPACE AND NOT SURROUNDED BY AN ATMOSPHERE SO THAT THE SUN'S RAYS HAVE FULL EFFECT UPON IT DURING THE TIME IT IS EXPOSED TO THEM
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0000.flac,SUMMER WAS NOW OVER THE WINTER FOLLOWING THE PLAGUE A SECOND TIME ATTACKED THE ATHENIANS FOR ALTHOUGH IT HAD NEVER ENTIRELY LEFT THEM STILL THERE HAD BEEN A NOTABLE ABATEMENT IN ITS RAVAGES

train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0016.flac,AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0020.flac,AT FIRST CAUSED SOME ALARM AT ATHENS WHICH THE EVENT HOWEVER DID NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE TOWN NEVER GIVING THEM ANY TROUBLE THE REASON OF THIS WAS AS FOLLOWS
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0034.flac,INDEED THE ATHENIAN ARMY FELL VICTIMS TO DEATH IN EVERY FORM AND SUFFERED ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0036.flac,ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE ATHENIANS ON THE COAST OF SICILY SAILED TO LOCRIS
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0037.flac,THE SAME SUMMER THE AETOLIANS WHO BEFORE THE ATHENIAN EXPEDITION HAD SENT AN EMBASSY TO CORINTH AND LACEDAEMON COMPOSED OF TOLOPHUS AN OPHIONIAN

train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0067.flac,WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE READY THEY JOINED BATTLE DEMOSTHENES BEING ON THE RIGHT WING WITH THE MESSENIANS AND A FEW ATHENIANS WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE WAS MADE UP OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE ACARNANIANS
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0069.flac,WHEN THE ACARNANIANS FROM THE AMBUSCADE SET UPON THEM FROM BEHIND AND BROKE THEM AT THE FIRST ATTACK WITHOUT THEIR STAYING TO RESIST
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0070.flac,RETURNING FROM THE PURSUIT THEY FOUND THEIR MAIN BODY DEFEATED AND HARD PRESSED BY THE ACARNANIANS WITH DIFFICULTY MADE GOOD THEIR PASSAGE TO OLPAE SUFFERING HEAVY LOSS ON THE WAY AS THEY DASHED ON WITHOUT DISCIPLINE OR ORDER
train-clean-360/581/126955/581-126955-0085.flac,BUT WE FOUGHT WITH NO ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE RETREAT

train-clean-360/581/126957/581-126957-0010.flac,THESE REPRESENTATIONS SUCCEEDING IT WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE MEN WERE CAUGHT SAILING OUT IN THE BOAT THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THE TREATY BECAME VOID ACCORDINGLY
train-clean-360/581/126957/581-126957-0015.flac,AND WITH STRIPS MADE FROM THEIR CLOTHING ADOPTING IN SHORT EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SELF DESTRUCTION

train-clean-360/581/126957/581-126957-0017.flac,ALL THE WOMEN TAKEN IN THE STRONGHOLD WERE SOLD AS SLAVES IN THIS WAY THE CORCYRAEANS OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE DESTROYED BY THE COMMONS AND SO AFTER TERRIBLE EXCESSES THE PARTY STRIFE CAME TO AN END
train-clean-360/581/126957/581-126957-0018.flac,FOR OF ONE PARTY THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NOTHING LEFT MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF TO SICILY THEIR PRIMARY DESTINATION AND CARRIED ON THE WAR WITH THEIR ALLIES THERE
train-clean-360/581/126957/581-126957-0019.flac,AND THE ACARNANIANS THEMSELVES SENDING SETTLERS FROM ALL PARTS OF ACARNANIA OCCUPIED THE PLACE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER

train-clean-360/5810/8674/5810-8674-0033.flac,AND THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WENT TO BATHE HE UNHOOKED THE SWORD FROM ITS NAIL AND BUCKLED IT ROUND HIS WAIST ON HIS RETURN TO THE CASTLE
train-clean-360/5810/8674/5810-8674-0047.flac,AND THE PRINCE NEVER WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S THRONE BUT LIVED PEACEFULLY WITH HIS WIFE IN THE FOREST WHERE

train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0026.flac,AND THERE WAS A QUEER WHITE MISTY PATCH IN THE SKY LIKE A HALO OF THE SUN THE FORE DECK PACKED WITH CHINAMEN WAS FULL OF SOMBRE CLOTHING YELLOW FACES AND PIGTAILS

train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0044.flac,AND A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE NAN SHAN STEAMED OUT TO THE EAST WITHOUT MAC WHIRR HAVING OFFERED ANY FURTHER REMARK AS TO HER FITTINGS
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0045.flac,THERE WERE MATTERS OF DUTY OF COURSE
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0047.flac,OLD MISTER SIGG LIKED A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND ONE THAT YOU COULD BE SURE WOULD NOT TRY TO IMPROVE UPON HIS INSTRUCTIONS

train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0059.flac,HE WENT ON WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT ELEPHANT THERE I TAKE IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF THE UNION JACK IN THE FLAG
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0062.flac,HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF A STOOPING LEISURELY CONDESCENSION
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0063.flac,HIS FLAT CHEEKS WERE PALE HIS BONY WRISTS AND LONG SCHOLARLY HANDS WERE PALE TOO
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0068.flac,SPEAKING JUST AUDIBLY AND GAZING AT HIS BOOTS AS HIS MANNER WAS
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0071.flac,TWENTY FIVE BAGS OF RICE WOULD BE COMING OFF IN A SAMPAN DIRECTLY FOR STORES ALL SEVEN YEARS' MEN THEY WERE SAID CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR WITH A CAMPHOR WOOD CHEST TO EVERY MAN

train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0097.flac,AND FROM HIS INEXPERIENCE OF JOLLY WOMEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT SHE MUST BE DEPLORABLY INSANE THEY WERE EXCELLENT FRIENDS AFTERWARDS
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0098.flac,HE CAME TO THINK SHE WAS A VERY WORTHY PERSON INDEED AND HE LEARNED IN TIME TO RECEIVE WITHOUT FLINCHING OTHER SCRAPS OF SOLOMON'S WISDOM FOR MY PART
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0099.flac,GIVE ME THE DULLEST ASS FOR A SKIPPER BEFORE A ROGUE
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0104.flac,SOMETIMES YOU WOULD THINK HE HADN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO SEE ANYTHING WRONG AND YET IT ISN'T THAT
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0107.flac,THAT'S HIS REGULAR PERFORMANCE BY AND BY HE SAYS
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0109.flac,I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN FIND TO TALK ABOUT SAYS HE
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0111.flac,IT MADE ME QUITE SORRY FOR HIM BUT HE IS EXASPERATING TOO SOMETIMES
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0112.flac,BUT IT ISN'T HE'S SO JOLLY INNOCENT THAT IF YOU WERE TO PUT YOUR THUMB TO YOUR NOSE AND WAVE YOUR FINGERS AT HIM
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0113.flac,HE'S TOO DENSE TO TROUBLE ABOUT AND THAT'S THE TRUTH
train-clean-360/583/139009/583-139009-0120.flac,WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN MADE TO SEE ALL IT MAY CONTAIN OF PERFIDY OF VIOLENCE AND OF TERROR THERE ARE ON SEA AND LAND SUCH MEN THUS FORTUNATE
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0014.flac,MY MOTHER AN OLD LADY WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HER GOVERNESS AND HAD ALWAYS LIVED WITH HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE THE NEW LORD THE ABBE MY FATHER AND MY UNCLE
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0017.flac,CLAD IN A LONG THREADBARE BLACK COAT UP TO MY MOTHER WHOSE SHOULDER THE ABBE'S HEAD HARDLY REACHED HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR THEM TO PASS OUT FIRST WITH HIS OWN HAND
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0018.flac,TO FOLLOW WITH THE TOTTERING OLD LADY ON HIS ARM AND THEN RETURNED TO LEAD THE PEER'S DAUGHTER DOWN TO DINNER HIMSELF HE ONLY RESUMED HIS WONTED EXPRESSION AND MANNER
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0019.flac,WHEN HE HAD SEEN THE LITTLE ABBE THE SQUALID HALF STARVED REPRESENTATIVE OF MIGHTY BARONS OF THE OLDEN TIME SEATED AT THE HIGHEST PLACE OF THE TABLE BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0022.flac,I BELIEVE IN HIS OWN WAY HE LOVED US ALL BUT WE HIS DESCENDANTS HAD TO SHARE HIS HEART WITH HIS ANCESTORS WE WERE HIS HOUSEHOLD PROPERTY AS WELL AS HIS CHILDREN
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0029.flac,OR MENTIONED MORE THAN GENERALLY MY AMBITIOUS HOPES AS A YOUNG MAN
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0032.flac,ANY IRRITATION HE SIMPLY ALTERED HIS MANNER TOWARDS US ALTOGETHER
train-clean-360/5868/54659/5868-54659-0038.flac,HE WOULD ALLOW US AS BOYS TO QUIT THE BREAKFAST TABLE BEFORE HE HAD RISEN HIMSELF
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0000.flac,MADAM HOW AND LADY WHY OR FIRST LESSONS IN EARTH LORE FOR CHILDREN
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0011.flac,AND SO ON AND SO ON TILL HE HAD BROUGHT HOME CURIOSITIES ENOUGH AND THOUGHTS ENOUGH TO LAST HIM A WEEK
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0013.flac,WHEREON MISTER ANDREWS SAYS WISELY ENOUGH IN HIS SOLEMN OLD FASHIONED WAY
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0014.flac,AND UPON THIS DIFFERENCE DEPENDS ALL THE SUPERIORITY OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH ONE MAN ACQUIRES OVER ANOTHER
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0016.flac,THE OBSERVING EYE AND INQUIRING MIND FIND MATTER OF IMPROVEMENT AND DELIGHT IN EVERY RAMBLE YOU THEN WILLIAM CONTINUE TO USE YOUR EYES AND YOU ROBERT
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0017.flac,USE SO SAID MISTER ANDREWS AND SO I SAY DEAR BOYS
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0019.flac,OR WHETHER THEY WILL LET OTHER PEOPLE LOOK FOR THEM OR PRETEND TO LOOK AND DUPE THEM AND LEAD THEM ABOUT THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND TILL BOTH FALL INTO THE DITCH
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0020.flac,I SAY GOOD BOYS NOT MERELY CLEVER BOYS OR PRUDENT BOYS BECAUSE USING YOUR EYES OR NOT USING THEM
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0025.flac,THERE ARE THINGS WHICH NEITHER YOUR SENSES NOR YOUR BRAINS CAN TELL YOU AND THEY ARE NOT ONLY MORE GLORIOUS BUT ACTUALLY MORE TRUE
train-clean-360/5868/55088/5868-55088-0036.flac,AS YOU HAVE USED THE EYES AND THE COMMON SENSE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN YOU AND HAVE CONSIDERED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0007.flac,AND SHE HELD A PINK COMB IN ONE HAND I NEVER SAW ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0010.flac,BEFORE LONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN ON OTHER SIDE BUT STRETCHES OF LOW SWAMPY LAND COVERED WITH STUNTED CYPRESS TREES FROM WHICH DROOPED DELICATE STREAMERS OF SPANISH MOSS
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0011.flac,I TURNED AND LOOKED NEW ORLEANS WAS JUST A COLORLESS MASS OF SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0018.flac,IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR THE TYPHOON WAS PLUNGING ABOUT IN THE MOST ALARMING FASHION I WAS SPEEDILY TUCKED AWAY IN THE UPPER BERTH WHERE I FELT A TRIFLE MORE EASY AT FIRST
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0020.flac,FOR DAYS AND DAYS I HAD NO SENSIBLE IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND ME THAT WE WERE BEING HURLED SOMEWHERE UPSIDE DOWN AND THAT I DIDN'T LIKE IT WAS ABOUT ALL I KNEW
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0024.flac,THE FIRST LAND SIGHTED BY VESSELS APPROACHING THE COAST FROM A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION THE VESSEL HAD CEASED TO ROLL AND MY SEA SICKNESS PASSED AWAY AS RAPIDLY AS IT CAME I WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
train-clean-360/5868/66166/5868-66166-0032.flac,WITH RINGS ON HER FINGERS AND BELLS ON HER TOES WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MUSIC ON ALL OCCASIONS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0005.flac,RECEIVED ITS FORM THE LIGHTS THEREFORE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0006.flac,THAT IS TO SAY ON THE SECOND DAY
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0009.flac,SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT IN RECAPITULATING THE DIVINE WORKS SCRIPTURE SAYS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0010.flac,IN THE SECOND OR WORK OF DISTINCTION
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0012.flac,BUT IT HAS BEEN STATED ABOVE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0013.flac,NAMELY THE HEAVEN THE WATER AND THE EARTH
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0016.flac,TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE INTERMEDIATE ELEMENT FOR THEY MOVE IN AIR AND WATER
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0017.flac,AND NOT MERELY VIRTUALLY FOR THE FIRMAMENT
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0021.flac,BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT FROM THE BEGINNING
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0023.flac,YET THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON IS MORE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES IN THIS LOWER WORLD MOREOVER AS FAR AS THE SENSES ARE CONCERNED ITS APPARENT SIZE IS GREATER
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0024.flac,WHETHER THE CAUSE ASSIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE LIGHTS IS REASONABLE OBJECTION ONE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0025.flac,WHICH THE HEATHENS FEAR THEREFORE THE HEAVENLY LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE TO BE SIGNS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0026.flac,FURTHER SIGN IS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM CAUSE BUT THE LIGHTS ARE THE CAUSE OF WHAT TAKES PLACE UPON THE EARTH THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT SIGNS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0027.flac,FURTHER THE DISTINCTION OF SEASONS AND DAYS BEGAN FROM THE FIRST DAY THEREFORE THE LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0028.flac,IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THEM
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0029.flac,FURTHER NOTHING IS MADE FOR THE SAKE OF THAT WHICH IS INFERIOR TO ITSELF
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0030.flac,THEREFORE THEY WERE NOT MADE TO ENLIGHTEN IT
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0032.flac,ON THE CONTRARY SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0036.flac,WHICH PREVENT WEARINESS PRESERVE HEALTH AND PROVIDE FOR THE NECESSITIES OF FOOD ALL OF WHICH THINGS COULD NOT BE SECURED
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0042.flac,CONSIDERED NOT IN ITSELF BUT AS ORDAINED TO THE GOOD OF THE UNIVERSE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0044.flac,WHETHER THE LIGHTS OF HEAVEN ARE LIVING BEINGS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0045.flac,A CAUSE IS NOBLER THAN ITS EFFECT BUT THE SUN MOON AND STARS ARE A CAUSE OF LIFE AS IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENCED IN THE CASE OF ANIMALS
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0046.flac,WHICH RECEIVE LIFE FROM THE POWER OF THE SUN AND STARS MUCH MORE THEREFORE HAVE THE HEAVENLY BODIES A LIVING SOUL
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0047.flac,WHICH IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ITS END YET FOR SOME OF THESE OPERATIONS AS SENSATION AND NUTRITION OUR BODY IS A NECESSARY INSTRUMENT HENCE IT IS CLEAR
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0049.flac,TO THEIR PRODUCTION THE INTELLECT FOR EXAMPLE
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0053.flac,CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES ACCORDINGLY THE UNION OF A SOUL TO A HEAVENLY BODY
train-clean-360/5876/10347/5876-10347-0056.flac,THAT THESE BODIES HAVE LIFE IS NOT A DIFFERENCE OF THINGS BUT OF WORDS
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0000.flac,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD I HAD NO HOME AND NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME AND I WANDERED FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH MY KNAPSACK ON MY BACK
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0001.flac,THOUGH WE SEARCHED AMONG THE BUSHES TILL NIGHT FELL AND THEN AS I DID NOT KNOW THE COUNTRY AND COULD NOT FIND MY WAY HOME IN THE DARK I DECIDED TO SLEEP UNDER A TREE
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0002.flac,HE HAD A GARLAND UPON HIS HEAD AND A GIRDLE OF OAK LEAVES ABOUT HIS BODY AND CARRIED AN UPROOTED FIR TREE IN HIS RIGHT HAND
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0003.flac,BUT AS I DID NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0004.flac,TAKE COURAGE FAINTHEARTED SHEPHERD
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0007.flac,SOME DAY YOU WILL RUE THIS AND LOOKED AT ME SADLY THEN HE CRIED
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0008.flac,DEEP UNDER THE EARTH AT TWILIGHT AND AT HIGH NOON IT IS HIDDEN BUT AT MIDNIGHT IT MAY BE DUG UP FOR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS HAVE I WATCHED OVER IT BUT NOW
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0013.flac,BUT BEWARE HOW YOU STRETCH OUT A HAND TOWARDS THE JEWELS IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVERN STANDS A COPPER CHEST IN THAT YOU WILL FIND GOLD AND SILVER
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0015.flac,DO NOT NEGLECT EACH TIME TO HEAP BACK THE LOOSE EARTH WHICH CONCEALED THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING'S TREASURE CHAMBER
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0016.flac,SO ENDED THE SHEPHERD'S TALE
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0022.flac,THE PARTY HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THIS SPEECH BUT BY THE TIME IT WAS ENDED THE HOUR WAS LATE AND THEY WENT THEIR WAYS HOMEWARD
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0025.flac,HIS CHOICE FELL UPON A WOMAN WHOSE EVIL TONGUE WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0028.flac,EVEN WHEN THE ILL MATCHED COUPLE WERE PRESENTLY BLESSED WITH CHILDREN HIS HAPPINESS WAS BUT SHORT LIVED THE SAVAGE TEMPER OF HIS QUARRELSOME WIFE SEEMED TO BLIGHT THEM FROM THE FIRST
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0032.flac,AND HE LOST ONE POST AFTER ANOTHER TILL AT LAST ALL HE COULD DO
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0038.flac,AND AT THIS THOUGHT SHE BROKE OUT INTO LOUD LAMENTATIONS BUT HER MOTHER ONLY CRIED
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0041.flac,THEY LED HIM MILES OVER HILL AND VALE STOCK AND STONE TO FIND A RAVEN'S BROOD
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0044.flac,IT COST MASTER PETER MANY STRUGGLES BEFORE HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO VISIT SUCH A PERSON BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND LITTLE AS HE LIKED IT
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0052.flac,HE CAREFULLY LOCKED THE EMPTY CUPBOARD AGAIN AND LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0053.flac,AND MASTER PETER NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THEY KNOCKED AND CALLED BUT NOTHING STIRRED WITHIN BUT THE HOUSE CAT
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0054.flac,THEN THE HOUSE WAS SEARCHED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR BUT NO MASTER PETER WAS TO BE FOUND WHO KNOWS
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0056.flac,AND REMORSE CAUSED HER THE GLOOMIEST FOREBODINGS AH LUCIA SHE CRIED
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0057.flac,AND THEY SAT TILL MORNING WEEPING OVER THEIR OWN FANCIES AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0058.flac,AND EVERY BEAM BUT LUCKILY MASTER PETER WAS NOT HANGING FROM ANY OF THEM AFTER THAT THE NEIGHBOURS WENT OUT WITH LONG POLES TO FISH IN EVERY DITCH AND POND BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0063.flac,OF WHOSE SKILL IN NEEDLEWORK HE HAD HEARD SO MUCH
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0064.flac,HOWEVER AS THE MEETING WOULD BE UNDER HER OWN EYE SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0068.flac,AFTER WHICH THE DAME MADE NO DIFFICULTIES AND THE MATTER WAS SPEEDILY SETTLED
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0069.flac,AND WHAT FRIEDLIN TOLD HER SEEMED TO MAKE LUCIA EVERY MOMENT MORE HAPPY AND CONTENTED
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0071.flac,IF ONLY HE COULD COME BACK AGAIN HERE WE ARE ROLLING IN RICHES WHILE HE MAY BE NIBBLING AT HUNGER'S TABLE AND THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A THING MADE HER WEEP
train-clean-360/5876/8675/5876-8675-0073.flac,AND THERE STOOD FATHER PETER
train-clean-360/5883/59268/5883-59268-0004.flac,BUT IT ANSWERED THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PUT WHICH WAS ONLY TO DRAW HIM INTO CONVERSATION
train-clean-360/5883/59268/5883-59268-0007.flac,WHAT IS IT THEN IT IS HALL SAID I
train-clean-360/5883/59268/5883-59268-0009.flac,TO BE SURE I WILL MY OLD COON TAKE IT TAKE IT AND WELCOME ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE

train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0064.flac,AND I THOUGHT HIS SOLE REASON FOR LEADING US TO THIS LOCALITY
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0065.flac,ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0066.flac,THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE THERE
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0067.flac,I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0073.flac,BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0077.flac,NO WITH A GESTURE HE ORDERED US TO CROUCH BESIDE HIM AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE CREVICE
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0080.flac,SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0081.flac,HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0083.flac,HOW COULD THIS POOR INDIAN EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CREATURES LIKE HIMSELF
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0086.flac,HIS MOVEMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED AND FOR HALF AN HOUR NO DANGER SEEMED TO THREATEN HIM
train-clean-360/6235/36641/6235-36641-0087.flac,WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE

train-clean-360/6269/66176/6269-66176-0006.flac,THIS EXCAVATION MADE THE APPROACH FROM THAT POINT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAGGED LEDGES WERE A GLITTER WITH ICE
train-clean-360/6269/66176/6269-66176-0010.flac,HEADED BY ONE MAT AMES OUR FORCES WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL J HARRIS BEFORE THE ACTION COMMENCED
train-clean-360/6269/66176/6269-66176-0012.flac,BUT ON THE CONTRARY WAS TO BE CONSIDERED A DISHONORABLE AND COWARDLY ACT THE NORTH ENDERS ON THE OTHER HAND AGREED TO GIVE UP THE FORT

train-clean-360/6269/66176/6269-66176-0043.flac,ON EACH SIDE WERE DISABLED IT WAS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR THE COMBATANTS TO HOLD UP A FLAG OF TRUCE WHILE THEY REMOVED SOME INSENSIBLE COMRADE
train-clean-360/6269/66176/6269-66176-0051.flac,THE EVENT PASSED INTO A LEGEND AND AFTERWARDS WHEN LATER INSTANCES OF PLUCK AND ENDURANCE WERE SPOKEN OF THE BOYS WOULD SAY
train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0007.flac,AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO TELL ME
train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0008.flac,IRRESOLUTELY AND THEN COMMENCED READING IT ALOUD
train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0011.flac,AND MY HEART UPBRAIDED ME FOR NOT FEELING A DEEPER GRIEF THAT A FULL SENSE OF MY LOSS WOULD NOW AND THEN SWEEP OVER ME LIKE AN INSPIRATION AND I WOULD STEAL AWAY TO MY CHAMBER
train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0014.flac,I SHALL NOT DWELL ON THIS PORTION OF MY STORY THERE WERE MANY TRANQUIL PLEASANT HOURS IN STORE FOR ME AT THAT PERIOD AND I PREFER TO TURN TO THEM

train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0024.flac,BY ANY BOY WHO HAS BEEN LONG ABSENT FROM HOME I WAS SORRY WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO DISCUSS QUESTIONS
train-clean-360/6269/66184/6269-66184-0034.flac,AND A MIST FILLED MY EYES SHUTTING OUT THE GROUP OF SCHOOLFELLOWS
train-clean-360/6269/66185/6269-66185-0001.flac,AND WHAT I DID AND WHAT I DID NOT ARE MATTERS THAT DO NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE PAGES BUT BEFORE I WRITE FINIS TO THE RECORD AS IT STANDS
train-clean-360/6269/66185/6269-66185-0028.flac,SO ENDS THE STORY OF A BAD BOY

train-clean-360/6286/69422/6286-69422-0002.flac,THAT SHE FINALLY RAISED HER WINDOW AND ALLOWED THE COOL WIND TO SOOTHE HER HEATED CHEEKS HOW CALM THE ASPECT OF THE LAWN AND ITS CLUSTERING SHRUBS

train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0009.flac,ARISTOCRACY LOGICALLY INVOLVES CASTES BUT SUCH CASTES AS EXIST IN INDIA AND THE SOCIAL CLASSES WE FIND IN THE WESTERN WORLD
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0024.flac,SO TOO IN POLITICAL SOCIETY STATESMANSHIP IS MADE POSSIBLE BY TRADITIONAL POLICIES GENERALSHIP BY MILITARY INSTITUTIONS
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0028.flac,THIS IDIOSYNCRASY IS BROUGHT OUT BY SOCIAL PRESSURE WHILE IN A STATE OF NATURE IT MIGHT HAVE BETRAYED ITSELF ONLY IN TRIVIAL AND FUTILE WAYS
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0032.flac,THERE IS A STRANGE METAPHYSICAL ILLUSION IN IMAGINING THAT A MAN MIGHT CHANGE HIS PARENTS HIS BODY HIS EARLY ENVIRONMENT AND YET RETAIN HIS PERSONALITY
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0033.flac,IN ITS HIGHER FACULTIES HIS PERSONALITY IS PRODUCED BY HIS SPECIAL RELATIONS
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0035.flac,THE SENSE OF INJUSTICE AT UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES ARISES ONLY WHEN THE TWO ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED ARE REALLY SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0038.flac,THIS WAS THE MADDEST POSSIBLE WAY OF REBELLING AGAINST HIS TRUE CREATOR
train-clean-360/6286/75355/6286-75355-0040.flac,AN EXCHANGE OF PLACES WITH SUCH REMOTE BEINGS WOULD TOO EVIDENTLY LEAVE EACH CREATURE THE VERY SAME THAT IT WAS BEFORE FOR AFTER A NOMINAL EXCHANGE OF PLACES

train-clean-360/6494/60801/6494-60801-0038.flac,AND FARED ON FROM PLACE TO PLACE TILL THEY APPROACHED THE WADY OF EMMETS
train-clean-360/6497/234067/6497-234067-0014.flac,THAN SHE COULD THE ORIGINAL BUT ON THE WHOLE SHE GOT ON BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IT WAS NOT TILL SHE CAME TO THE FIFTH HEAD
train-clean-360/6497/234067/6497-234067-0017.flac,SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF HER MASTER'S VOICE AND LOOKED IN GLAD SURPRISE
train-clean-360/6497/234067/6497-234067-0018.flac,VERY BADLY CAN'T YOU SEE
train-clean-360/6497/234067/6497-234067-0030.flac,BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT MONEY AND IN A RAPID GLANCE MISS LAURENCE ROUGHLY CALCULATED THE PRICE OF MILDRED'S CLOTHES A TALL

train-clean-360/6497/234100/6497-234100-0013.flac,THEIR INTERESTS WERE MUTUAL THEY WERE IDENTICAL THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF EGOTISM
train-clean-360/6497/234100/6497-234100-0014.flac,IT HAD HAUNTED HIS THOUGHT IT HAD BECOME HIS DAILY COMPANION HIS FAMILIAR SPIRIT
train-clean-360/6497/234100/6497-234100-0017.flac,AND OBEYING AN INSTINCT HE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUME DOWN HE KNEW IT WELL
train-clean-360/6497/234100/6497-234100-0020.flac,WHICH HE WAS DESTINED TO FULFIL IF A HABIT AFFECTS US
train-clean-360/6497/234100/6497-234100-0032.flac,AND FURTHER AWAY PAST THE SHADOWY SHORE WAS WORTHING

train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0000.flac,IT HAS BEEN GRAVELY ASSERTED THAT THE CONFESSION OF SIN AND THE DOCTRINE OF ABSOLUTION TEND TO THE SPREAD OF CRIME AND IMMORALITY
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0002.flac,AS ALL OUR CATECHISMS TEACH AND AS EVERY CATHOLIC KNOWS THERE IS NO PARDON OF SIN WITHOUT SORROW OF HEART AND PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0005.flac,NIGHTS AMONG ROMANISTS AND SIMILAR ABSOLUTELY UNRELIABLE COMPILATIONS THE FALSE STATEMENTS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN REFUTED
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0008.flac,OR THEY ARE NOT IN VERY GENERAL CIRCULATION
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0012.flac,I WILL HERE INSERT AS CORRECT A TABLE AS CAN BE MADE FROM THE LATEST REPORTS
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0013.flac,FRANCE SEVEN POINT TWO PRUSSIA
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0015.flac,THE PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BIRTHS IS IN IRELAND THREE POINT EIGHT PER CENT IN ENGLAND THE PROPORTION IS SIX POINT FOUR
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0023.flac,BUT WE ARE NOT DISPOSED TO PARADE THESE MONSTROUS VICES NO MATTER BY WHOM COMMITTED WE ALLUDE TO THEM WITH FEELINGS OF SHAME NOT OF PLEASURE
train-clean-360/6499/57667/6499-57667-0024.flac,WHICH THEIR RELIGION AFFORDS OUGHT TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE YET WE WILL ADD QUOTING THE WORDS OF THE CATHOLIC WORLD

train-clean-360/6499/87508/6499-87508-0033.flac,IF WE TOUCH THEM ON THESE POINTS IT WILL BE LIKE PLAYING AN ACCOMPANIMENT TO AN INSTRUMENT WITH ONE STRING OUT OF TUNE
train-clean-360/6499/87508/6499-87508-0035.flac,TO CHEER AND CONSOLE THEM TO FORESEE THEIR WANTS AND THEREBY TO SPARE THEM THE PAIN OR HUMILIATION OF ASKING FOR ANYTHING
train-clean-360/6499/87508/6499-87508-0048.flac,TO HAVE A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE WHOLE ORDER IN ITS WORKS ITS SUCCESS AND ITS FAILURES
train-clean-360/6499/87508/6499-87508-0057.flac,AS THE ARTIST STUDIES THE MASTERPIECES TO REPRODUCE THEIR MARVELLOUS TINTS IN PICTURES WHICH IN THEIR TURN BECOME MODELS
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0006.flac,THESE USUALLY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING FOR GRANTED THE INVARIABLE EXISTENCE OF SENTIMENT AND OF ADDRESSING IT EXCLUSIVELY
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0009.flac,WE OWE HIM HOMAGE FOR IT AS FOR ALL OTHERS BUT GOD ONLY REQUIRES THAT EACH OF HIS CREATURES SHOULD RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE HAS RECEIVED
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0011.flac,THEY WILL THEN SEE HOW THE WILL ALONE WITHOUT THE AID OF FEELING CAN PRODUCE ACTS OF ALL THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0013.flac,FOR IF I GO FROM THEE I FLEE FROM LIFE AND IF I APPROACH UNWORTHILY
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0018.flac,IN ORDER THAT THE PRECIOUS REMEMBRANCE OF IT SHOULD SERVE ME AS SUPPORT IN THE DAYS OF TRIAL AND TEMPTATION ACT OF HOPE
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0021.flac,AND THEREFORE I HOPE ACT OF LOVE
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0024.flac,THAT I AM NOT INDIFFERENT TO THIS MOST HOLY SACRAMENT WHICH I APPROACH UNMOVED BY ANY SENSIBLE FEELING
train-clean-360/6499/91098/6499-91098-0029.flac,AND THIS I DO NO MY GOD I SHALL NOT PRAY THEE TO GRANT ME SENSIBLE ENJOYMENT

train-clean-360/6505/231836/6505-231836-0028.flac,THE SAME ROUTINE WAS OBSERVED EACH MORNING AND EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY MISSUS KEBBY HAD HEARD OF THE BLIND SHADOWS FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE
train-clean-360/6505/231836/6505-231836-0029.flac,BUT IN THIS QUEST WHICH WAS INTENDED TO PUT MONEY INTO HER OWN POCKET SHE FAILED ENTIRELY AND DURING THE WHOLE SIX MONTHS OF BERWIN'S TENANCY
train-clean-360/6505/231836/6505-231836-0037.flac,WELL I DON'T CARE HE'S PAID ME UP TILL TO NIGHT
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0005.flac,AS THE SEX OF THE ASSASSIN FOR OBVIOUS REASONS COULD NOT BE DECIDED MISSUS KEBBY SWORE THAT SHE HAD LEFT THE DECEASED SITTING OVER THE FIRE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON CHRISTMAS EVE
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0010.flac,BUT HE WAS PREPARED TO SWEAR AND IN FACT DID SWEAR AT THE INQUEST THAT NO STRANGER EITHER CAME INTO OR WENT OUT OF GENEVA SQUARE
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0014.flac,HE HAD NOT INSISTED UPON HAVING THEM THE DECEASED SAID THE LANDLORD HAD PAID A MONTH'S RENT IN ADVANCE IN READY MONEY
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0019.flac,EVERY INCH OF IT AND WITH THE RESULT THAT I HAVE FOUND NOTHING THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE CASE ARE MOST MYSTERIOUS IF WE DO NOT IDENTIFY THE DEAD WE CANNOT HOPE TO TRACE THE MURDERER
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0021.flac,I ALLUDE TO THE SHADOWS ON THE BLIND WHICH I SAW MYSELF A WEEK BEFORE THE MURDER TOOK PLACE THEY WERE THOSE OF A MAN AND A WOMAN
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0022.flac,THEREFORE TWO PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN IN BERWIN'S SITTING ROOM ON THAT NIGHT
train-clean-360/6505/231837/6505-231837-0023.flac,MORE HE ACTUALLY INSISTED THAT I SHOULD SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THE TRUTH OF THIS BY EXAMINING THE HOUSE WHICH YOU DID YES BUT FOUND NOTHING YET

train-clean-360/7294/86026/7294-86026-0065.flac,AND SHE WENT DOWN TO THE LAKE TO CONSULT THE OLD WOMAN
train-clean-360/7294/86026/7294-86026-0066.flac,SHE ASKED WHEN AFTER CLAPPING HER HANDS THE OLD WOMAN APPEARED BEFORE HER
train-clean-360/7294/86026/7294-86026-0067.flac,AND EVER SINCE HE HAS ENTREATED ME TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS DAUGHTER IF I LET HER GO HE MUST PAY ME A THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE IN EXCHANGE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN
train-clean-360/7294/86026/7294-86026-0070.flac,DILAH WHOM HER FATHER MASILO CAST OUT
train-clean-360/7294/92934/7294-92934-0008.flac,THEN ALL COMMUNICATION WITH THE MAINLAND WAS CUT OFF AND FOR DAYS AT A TIME
train-clean-360/7294/92934/7294-92934-0025.flac,AND REMAINED THERE THE SEAS BREAKING COMPLETELY OVER IT SOME OF THE CREW LAUNCHED A BOAT AND ESCAPED DESERTING THEIR CAPTAIN

train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0008.flac,BEAUTIFUL BINDINGS WERE STILL HIGHLY VALUED AND SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL WORK PRODUCED IN FRANCE BELONGS TO THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0009.flac,BUT AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO BUY BOOKS FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED LESS EXAGGERATED IMPORTANCE WAS ATTACHED TO THEIR EXTERIOR SO THAT BINDINGS THOUGH PERFECT AS TASTE AND SKILL COULD MAKE THEM
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0013.flac,TO BE DECORATIVE A BOOKCASE NEED NOT CONTAIN THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE MASTER BINDERS
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0020.flac,IT HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THE PLAN OF BUILDING BOOK SHELVES INTO THE WALLS IS THE MOST DECORATIVE AND THE MOST PRACTICAL
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0021.flac,THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THIS TREATMENT ARE FOUND IN FRANCE THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS THUS DECORATED WERE USUALLY OF PANELLED WOOD EITHER IN NATURAL OAK OR WALNUT
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0022.flac,WILL SHOW HOW SELDOM THE DETACHED BOOKCASE WAS USED IN FRENCH LIBRARIES BUT FEW MODELS ARE TO BE FOUND AND THESE WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE BOUDOIR OR STUDY
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0023.flac,IN ENGLAND WHERE PRIVATE LIBRARIES WERE FEWER AND LESS EXTENSIVE THE MOVABLE BOOKCASE WAS MUCH USED AND EXAMPLES OF BUILT IN SHELVES ARE PROPORTIONATELY RARER
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0029.flac,AND SUFFICIENT IN NUMBER TO DOMINATE ALL THE ACCESSORY DECORATIONS OF THE ROOM WHEN THERE ARE BOOKS ENOUGH IT IS BEST TO USE THEM AS PART OF THE DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF THE WALLS
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0030.flac,SPACE MAY OF COURSE BE GAINED BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF BOOKCASES PROJECTING INTO THE ROOM AND FORMING DEEP BAYS ALONG EACH OF THE WALLS BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT IS SELDOM NECESSARY SAVE IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0032.flac,SINCE THE LATTER WORD SEEMS TO HAVE ATTAINED THE DIGNITY OF A TECHNICAL TERM
train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0034.flac,A ROLLER TOP DESK A REVOLVING CHAIR AND OTHERS OF THE PUFFY TYPE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS THE ACCEPTED MODEL OF A LUXURIOUS SEAT

train-clean-360/7297/275885/7297-275885-0041.flac,THE BEST WAY OF OBTAINING AN EFFECT OF SIZE IS TO PANEL THE WALLS BY MEANS OF CLEAR CUT ARCHITECTURAL MOULDINGS A FEW STRONG VERTICAL LINES WILL GIVE DIGNITY TO THE ROOM AND HEIGHT TO THE CEILING
train-clean-360/7297/92812/7297-92812-0004.flac,HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR

train-clean-360/7398/98877/7398-98877-0028.flac,THESE DEVELOPMENTS LEAD US TO SUSPECT THAT URTICARIA AND PEMPHIGUS ARE IDENTICAL IN ESSENCE
train-clean-360/7398/98877/7398-98877-0029.flac,IN EITHER CASE IF THE VITAL FORCES ARE PROSTRATED AND THE SENSITIVENESS OF THE ORGANIC REACTION IS CONSIDERABLE

train-clean-360/7398/98878/7398-98878-0015.flac,IN ORDER TO ABBREVIATE THE TORTURES INHERENT IN THIS MALADY THIS RESULT IS MOST CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF APIS
train-clean-360/7398/98878/7398-98878-0017.flac,NOTWITHSTANDING HAHNEMANN'S TEACHINGS CONCERNING THE MEDICINAL POWER OF SULPHUR WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW BEEN IN POSSESSION OF FOR YEARS AND WHICH THE MOST THOUGHTFUL MINDS HAVE ACCEPTED AS A TRUTH

train-clean-360/7398/98880/7398-98880-0018.flac,THE TWO REMEDIES SHOULD BE GIVEN IN ALTERNATION
train-clean-360/7398/98880/7398-98880-0019.flac,SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY QUIET SLEEP AND RECOVERY ON WAKING MAY WE NOT EXPECT THE SAME RESULT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF ASIATIC CHOLERA
train-clean-360/7398/98880/7398-98880-0021.flac,AND FINALLY BRINGING ON ITS INSEPARABLE COMPANION THE LAST DEGREE OF HYPOCHONDRIA THIS MISERY IS SO MUCH MORE LAMENTABLE AS IT IS SO TO SAY

train-clean-360/7555/101283/7555-101283-0032.flac,WHEN THE EMPEROR WAS FAST ASLEEP THE BED BEGAN TO CRACK LOUDLY AND TO THE EMPRESS EACH CRACK HAD A MEANING

train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0006.flac,THAT THE INTELLECT IS SEPARATE AND THAT IT IS NOT THE ACT OF ANY BODY THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0009.flac,TWO WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF THE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0011.flac,BUT THE FORM OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS NOT RECEIVED INTO THE INTELLECT MATERIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT RATHER IMMATERIALLY AND UNIVERSALLY
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0016.flac,THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0027.flac,NOW AN ACTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANYONE IN THREE WAYS AS IS CLEAR FROM THE PHILOSOPHER
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0032.flac,IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTELLECT BY WHICH SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS IS A PART OF SOCRATES SO THAT IN SOME WAY IT IS UNITED TO THE BODY OF SOCRATES
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0038.flac,UNDERSTANDS BUT THAT HE OR HIS PHANTASMS ARE UNDERSTOOD SOME HOWEVER TRIED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE INTELLECT IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS MOTOR
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0046.flac,WHENCE ARISTOTLE CONCLUDES
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0055.flac,SO THE HUMAN SOUL RETAINS ITS PROPER EXISTENCE WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE BODY HAVING AN APTITUDE AND A NATURAL INCLINATION TO BE UNITED TO THE BODY
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0064.flac,BECAUSE EVEN IF THERE WERE BUT ONE IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE AN INDIVIDUAL INTELLECT AND THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT UNDERSTANDS AN INDIVIDUAL SPECIES
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0066.flac,YET IT IS THE STONE WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD NOT THE LIKENESS OF THE STONE
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0070.flac,THAT A THING IS PERCEIVED BY THE SENSE ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION WHICH IT HAS OUTSIDE THE SOUL THAT IS IN ITS INDIVIDUALITY
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0073.flac,ONE KNOWLEDGE EXISTS IN THE DISCIPLE AND ANOTHER IN THE MASTER HOW IT IS CAUSED WILL BE SHOWN LATER ON
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0074.flac,AUGUSTINE DENIES A PLURALITY OF SOULS THAT WOULD INVOLVE A PLURALITY OF SPECIES
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0078.flac,FURTHER IF IT BE SAID THAT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN MAN IS INCORRUPTIBLE ON THE CONTRARY CORRUPTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE DIFFER GENERICALLY SAYS THE PHILOSOPHER
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0079.flac,BUT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN THE HORSE THE LION AND OTHER BRUTE ANIMALS IS CORRUPTIBLE IF THEREFORE IN MAN IT BE INCORRUPTIBLE
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0084.flac,THEN A BIPED ANIMAL IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ONE FOR THIS REASON AGAINST THOSE WHO HOLD THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SOULS IN THE BODY
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0086.flac,SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BY THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE THING IS PREDICATED OF ANOTHER
train-clean-360/7956/245687/7956-245687-0098.flac,AND ANIMAL BY ANOTHER BUT BY ONE AND THE SAME SOUL HE IS BOTH ANIMAL AND MAN
train-clean-360/7957/39967/7957-39967-0042.flac,MEANS NONE THE LESS AN ABSENCE OF MIND AND A CORRESPONDING DISTORTION OF EMOTIONAL LIFE

train-clean-360/7957/39967/7957-39967-0085.flac,YET THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THE THEORY WAS PROPOUNDED WAS SO UNDEMOCRATIC THAT PLATO COULD NOT WORK OUT A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM WHOSE TERMS HE CLEARLY SAW
train-clean-360/7957/39967/7957-39967-0089.flac,THERE WERE ONLY THREE TYPES OF FACULTIES OR POWERS IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S CONSTITUTION HENCE EDUCATION WOULD SOON REACH A STATIC LIMIT IN EACH CLASS
train-clean-360/7957/39967/7957-39967-0094.flac,AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT RECOGNIZING THAT A SOCIETY MIGHT CHANGE AND YET BE STABLE HIS DOCTRINE OF LIMITED POWERS AND CLASSES CAME IN NET EFFECT TO THE IDEA OF THE SUBORDINATION OF INDIVIDUALITY

train-clean-360/7967/104986/7967-104986-0028.flac,BUT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF THE ENIGMATIC SCENE I HAD WITNESSED AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE NECESSARILY INTERESTED ME VERY MUCH AND I COULD NOT HELP GIVING IT A LOOK

train-clean-360/7967/117095/7967-117095-0030.flac,BUT THE MURMUR OF GIBBERING VOICES FIVE YEARS AGO HE LURED THE VOICES AND THE CREATURES FROM THEIR CAVES TO THE MOUNTAIN TOPS TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME

train-clean-360/7981/112056/7981-112056-0005.flac,VINCENT WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A LIFE SPENT IN EARNEST WORK AMONG HIS PEOPLE WHEN A SUMMONS FROM FATHER DE BERULLE RECALLED HIM SUDDENLY TO PARIS
train-clean-360/7981/112056/7981-112056-0006.flac,NOTHING LESS THAN THE RESIGNATION OF HIS BELOVED CLICHY WAS NOW ASKED OF HIM BY THIS FRIEND TO WHOM HE OWED SO MUCH ONE OF THE GREATEST NOBLEMEN OF FRANCE
train-clean-360/7981/112056/7981-112056-0008.flac,HE OWED TOO MUCH TO DE BERULLE TO REFUSE SETTING OUT FROM CLICHY WITH HIS WORLDLY GOODS ON A HAND BARROW HE ARRIVED AT THE ORATORY

train-clean-360/7981/112056/7981-112056-0027.flac,AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WOULD BE USED AGAINST HIM
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0000.flac,THE GALLEYS
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0003.flac,BUT THE NEW RECTOR HAD HIS OWN IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0004.flac,HIS FIRST STEP WAS TO BE RECONCILED TO THE CHURCH HIS SECOND TO BEGIN TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THE POOR GRADUALLY HIS BAD COMPANIONS DROPPED AWAY
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0007.flac,I AM A WRETCH AND A SINNER HE CRIED BUT TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I WILL DO IT
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0014.flac,ONE DAY AS VINCENT WAS ABOUT TO SAY MASS ONE OF THESE LADIES BEGGED HIM TO SPEAK TO THE CONGREGATION IN FAVOR OF A POOR FAMILY WHOSE MEMBERS WERE SICK AND STARVING
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0016.flac,THERE WAS NO WANT OF CHARITY BUT IT NEEDED ORGANIZATION
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0017.flac,EACH IN TURN PROMISING TO PROVIDE A DAY'S FOOD FOR STARVING FAMILIES THUS
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0018.flac,AND EVERY GOOD WOMAN MIGHT BELONG TO IT
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0019.flac,AND HAVE SINCE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE DE GONDIS IN THE MEANTIME HAD DISCOVERED THE PLACE OF VINCENT'S RETREAT
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0020.flac,PITEOUSLY URGING HIM TO RETURN
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0029.flac,BLASPHEMING AND FIGHTING THE GALLEY SLAVES MADE A PICTURE SUGGESTIVE ONLY OF HELL
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0030.flac,THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE MONSEIGNEUR HE CRIED YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THEM BEFORE GOD THE GENERAL WAS AGHAST
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0034.flac,WHO PROMPTLY MADE VINCENT DE PAUL ALMONER TO THE KING'S SHIPS WITH THE HONORS AND PRIVILEGES OF A NAVAL OFFICER AND A SALARY OF SIX HUNDRED LIVRES
train-clean-360/7981/112057/7981-112057-0038.flac,IN THE MEANTIME THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF VINCENT'S FRIENDS HOSPITALS WERE BEING BUILT
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0006.flac,IT WAS STIPULATED HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN AS HE HAD ALREADY PROMISED IN THE HOUSE OF THE FOUNDERS A CONDITION WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO DOOM THE ENTERPRISE TO FAILURE
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0007.flac,THE SOLUTION WAS ALTOGETHER UNEXPECTED TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE CONTRACT OF FOUNDATION
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0008.flac,AND SHE DIED A FEW DAYS LATER
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0009.flac,BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS LEAVING THAT WORLD WHERE HE HAD SHONE SO BRILLIANTLY
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0013.flac,THE MISSION PRIESTS DID GOOD WHEREVER THEY WENT EVERYBODY WANTED THEM
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0019.flac,WEEKLY GATHERINGS WERE HELD AT SAINT LAZARE UNDER THE NAME OF TUESDAY CONFERENCES
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0021.flac,HERE AS IN SO MANY OTHER CASES IT WAS THE CONGREGATION OF THE LADIES OF CHARITY FOUNDED BY VINCENT IN PARIS
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0022.flac,WHO LEFT A WIDOW AT THE AGE OF TWENTY DEVOTED HERSELF AND HER ENORMOUS FORTUNE TO ALMS AND GOOD WORKS
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0023.flac,AFTER THE MOVE TO SAINT LAZARE THE UNDERTAKING HAD GROWN AND PROSPERED
train-clean-360/7981/112058/7981-112058-0025.flac,SO THE WORK OF THE CONGREGATION INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED UNTIL IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HUMAN CAPACITY BUT VINCENT KNEW WHEREIN LAY THE STRENGTH OF THE MISSION PRIESTS
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0000.flac,DURING THE LAST DAYS OF THE KING'S LIFE VINCENT NEVER LEFT HIM
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0003.flac,WHOSE BUSINESS IT WOULD BE TO HELP HER WITH ADVICE AS TO ECCLESIASTICAL PREFERMENT MAZARIN'S ASTONISHMENT AND DISGUST WHEN HE HEARD THAT VINCENT DE PAUL HAD BEEN APPOINTED ONE OF THE NUMBER
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0009.flac,THE ANSWER WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR A SCRUPULOUS CLEANLINESS WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG GALLERIES OF THE LOUVRE
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0011.flac,HE CONSIDERED THAT BISHOPRICS AND ABBEYS WERE USEFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN RESERVE AS BRIBES FOR HIS WAVERING ADHERENTS CERTAIN REFORMS ON WHICH VINCENT INSISTED WERE NOT TO HIS MIND EITHER
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0013.flac,BUT IT BECAME QUITE INTOLERABLE WHEN THE SHABBY PRIEST REFUSED TO LISTEN
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0014.flac,YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER ACCOMPANIED BY A GOOD NATURED SMILE
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0015.flac,INSULTED ANOTHER DAY IN PUBLIC BY A MAGISTRATE WHOSE INTERESTS HE HAD REFUSED TO FORWARD
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0017.flac,POITIERS TO HER SON A YOUNG MAN OF VERY BAD CHARACTER
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0018.flac,BUT MADAME DECLINED CURTLY
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0020.flac,AND WAS SHOWN INTO THE QUEEN'S PRESENCE OH SAID HER MAJESTY NOT WITHOUT SOME EMBARRASSMENT
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0021.flac,WITHOUT A WORD VINCENT HANDED HER THE ROLL WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO UNFOLD
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0022.flac,THE FORM IS NOT DRAWN UP AT ALL IF YOUR MAJESTY'S MIND IS MADE UP SAID VINCENT QUIETLY I MUST BEG YOU TO WRITE DOWN YOUR WISHES YOURSELF
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0023.flac,THEN NOTICING THE HESITATION OF THE QUEEN MADAME HE SAID HOTLY THIS MAN WHOM YOU INTEND TO MAKE A BISHOP SPENDS HIS LIFE IN PUBLIC HOUSES AND IS CARRIED HOME DRUNK EVERY NIGHT
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0024.flac,SEIZING A HEAVY STOOL SHE FLUNG IT AT THE HEAD OF THE UNWELCOME MESSENGER WHO BOWED AND RETIRED FROM THE HOUSE WITH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HIS FOREHEAD
train-clean-360/7981/112061/7981-112061-0026.flac,TO WHAT LENGTHS THE AFFECTION OF A MOTHER FOR HER SON WILL GO
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0010.flac,GALOCHES LINED WITH FUR
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0016.flac,AND FOR NO OTHER SUCH AS RICH BLOND CAPS ORNAMENTED WITH FLOWERS
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0018.flac,AND THOSE IN THE PROFESSION OF THE LAW SHOULD AVOID HAVING A FASHIONABLE OR MILITARY COSTUME WHICH IS GENERALLY ADOPTED BY STUDENTS COMMERCIAL MEN
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0028.flac,IT IS MORE PROPER THAT OLD PERSONS SHOULD SHOW THEIR WHITE AND NOBLE HEADS OLD LADIES
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0030.flac,LADIES OUGHT TO ADOPT IN SUMMER LIGHT GARMENTS AND DELICATE COLORS
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0031.flac,THEY MUST SELECT STUFFS FOR WINTER OR SUMMER AS MAY BE SUITABLE
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0034.flac,WHO DOES NOT PERCEIVE HOW LAUGHABLE IT IS TO SEE A LADY WHO IS CLOTHED IN SATIN LACE OR VELVET LABORIOUSLY TRAVELLING IN THE DUST OR MUD
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0039.flac,CONSIDERATION IS NOT ACQUIRED BY WORDS AN ARTICLE SO PRECIOUS DEMANDS A REAL VALUE IT DEMANDS ALSO THE ASSISTANCE OF DISCRETION
train-clean-360/7982/110054/7982-110054-0041.flac,THAT POWERFUL MEANS OF OBTAINING CONSIDERATION BY ITS ELEVATED AND RELIGIOUS NATURE IS NOT WITHIN OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITENESS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0000.flac,QUESTION SEVENTY NINE OF THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0002.flac,FIVE WHETHER THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS ONE IN ALL SIX WHETHER MEMORY IS IN THE INTELLECT SEVEN
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0006.flac,FOR THE INTELLECT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME AS THE MIND NOW THE MIND IS NOT A POWER OF THE SOUL BUT THE ESSENCE FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0007.flac,MIND AND SPIRIT ARE NOT RELATIVE THINGS BUT DENOMINATE THE ESSENCE THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0008.flac,FURTHER DIFFERENT GENERA OF THE SOUL'S POWERS ARE NOT UNITED IN SOME ONE POWER BUT ONLY IN THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0009.flac,BUT THEY ARE UNITED IN THE MIND FOR AUGUSTINE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0012.flac,ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER ASSIGNS THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTY AS A POWER OF THE SOUL
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0013.flac,I ANSWER THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SHOWN
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0016.flac,WHEREFORE IN GOD ALONE IS HIS INTELLECT HIS ESSENCE WHILE IN OTHER INTELLECTUAL CREATURES THE INTELLECT IS A POWER
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0018.flac,AND IN LIKE MANNER THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS SOMETIMES CALLED INTELLECT AS FROM ITS CHIEF POWER AND THUS WE READ
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0019.flac,THAT THE INTELLECT IS A SUBSTANCE AND IN THIS SENSE ALSO AUGUSTINE SAYS THAT THE MIND IS SPIRIT AND ESSENCE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0021.flac,AND PARTLY WITH THE SENSITIVE IN ITS MODE OF OPERATION
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0023.flac,BUT THAT IT IS ITS VIRTUE AND POWER
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0024.flac,BUT THE INTELLECTUAL POWER RESULTS FROM THE IMMATERIALITY OF THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE THEREFORE IT SEEMS THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT A PASSIVE POWER
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0025.flac,BUT IF THE INTELLECT IS PASSIVE IT IS CORRUPTIBLE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0031.flac,ALL BEING PRE EXISTS AS IN ITS FIRST CAUSE AND THEREFORE THE DIVINE INTELLECT IS NOT IN POTENTIALITY BUT IS PURE ACT
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0035.flac,AND IS AT FIRST LIKE A CLEAN TABLET ON WHICH NOTHING IS WRITTEN AS THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0036.flac,IS IN A WAY TO BE PASSIVE TAKING PASSION IN THE THIRD SENSE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE INTELLECT IS A PASSIVE POWER
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0037.flac,WHICH BELONG TO PRIMARY MATTER BUT IN THE THIRD SENSE PASSION IS IN ANYTHING WHICH IS REDUCED FROM POTENTIALITY TO ACT
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0038.flac,BUT THE INTELLECT WHICH IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE AND WHICH FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE CALLS THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0039.flac,IS NOT PASSIVE EXCEPT IN THE THIRD SENSE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0040.flac,HENCE IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0041.flac,THE AGENT IS NOBLER THAN THE PATIENT IF THE ACTION AND THE PASSION ARE REFERRED TO THE SAME THING BUT NOT ALWAYS IF THEY REFER TO DIFFERENT THINGS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0044.flac,SINCE OUR INTELLECT IS IN POTENTIALITY TO THINGS INTELLIGIBLE IT SEEMS THAT WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE INTELLECT IS ACTIVE BUT ONLY THAT IT IS PASSIVE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0049.flac,TO MAKE THE SPECIES ACTUALLY INTELLIGIBLE ON THE CONTRARY THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0057.flac,WHEREAS IN THE SENSITIVE PART ALL ARE PASSIVE BUT IN THE INTELLECTUAL PART THERE IS SOMETHING ACTIVE AND SOMETHING PASSIVE
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0063.flac,HE WAS THE TRUE LIGHT THAT ENLIGHTENETH EVERY MAN COMING INTO THIS WORLD THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN THE SOUL
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0065.flac,THEREFORE THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS NOT SOMETHING IN OUR SOUL
train-clean-360/7982/245691/7982-245691-0070.flac,FURTHER IF THE ACTIVE INTELLECT IS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL IT MUST BE A POWER FOR IT IS NEITHER A PASSION NOR A HABIT
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0001.flac,THOSE QUESTIONS ON WHICH MEN MIGHT REASON HAD BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF JUDICIAL DECISION
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0003.flac,TO PERFORM HIS PUBLIC DUTY HAVING TAKEN WITH HIM HIS NEGRO SLAVE THE COURT HOWEVER IN GIVING THEIR DECISION IN THIS CASE OR THEIR OPINION
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0005.flac,AND HERE LET ME SAY I CAN NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO AGREED ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF THE SLAVEHOLDER TO TAKE HIS PROPERTY INTO THE TERRITORY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0006.flac,THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE CONGRESS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE TERRITORY TO LEGISLATE UPON THAT SUBJECT SHOULD BE A JUDICIAL QUESTION
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0018.flac,NO TRIBUNAL ACTING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES WHETHER IT BE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIAL HAS A RIGHT TO DRAW SUCH A DISTINCTION
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0019.flac,OR DENY TO IT THE BENEFIT OF THE PROVISIONS AND GUARANTEES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0020.flac,THIS IS DONE IN PLAIN WORDS TOO PLAIN TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND NO WORD CAN BE FOUND IN THE CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES CONGRESS A GREATER POWER OVER SLAVE PROPERTY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0023.flac,BY BEING CARRIED INTO THIS TERRITORY EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED THERE BY THE OWNER
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0025.flac,HAS THE POWER TO INVADE OR IMPAIR THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A TERRITORY I WILL NOT INQUIRE WHETHER IT BE TECHNICALLY A DECISION OR NOT
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0027.flac,I NEVER GAVE IT COUNTENANCE AND I AM NOW LEAST OF ALL DISPOSED TO GIVE IT QUARTER IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT IT MADE ITS APPEARANCE FOR GOOD PURPOSES
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0029.flac,I BEING TOGETHER WITH SOME OTHER PERSONS ASKED
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0030.flac,A FALLACY FRAUGHT WITH MISCHIEF THAT IT ESCAPED AN ISSUE WHICH WAS UPON US WHICH IT WAS OUR DUTY TO MEET
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0035.flac,HAVING WON IT BY SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES UNKNOWN TO HISTORY WITHOUT GRANT OR WITHOUT REVOLUTION WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE HE ADHERING TO THE THEORY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0036.flac,I SAY LAY YOUR HAND UPON THE CONSTITUTION AND FIND THERE THE WARRANT OF YOUR AUTHORITY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0037.flac,WHAT IS THERE TO SUSTAIN YOUR THEORY
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0039.flac,CAN THIS BE A DEFINITION OF SOVEREIGNTY BUT AGAIN SIR
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0041.flac,THE STATES WERE THE GRANTORS THEY MADE THE COMPACT THEY GAVE THE FEDERAL AGENT ITS POWERS THEY INHIBITED THEMSELVES FROM DOING CERTAIN THINGS
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0042.flac,THEREFORE ITS POWERS ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE POWERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE ONE IS THE CREATURE OF GRANT
train-clean-360/7991/102381/7991-102381-0043.flac,AND THE OTHER THE EXPONENT OF SOVEREIGN POWER THE SUPREME COURT HAVE COVERED THE WHOLE GROUND OF THE RELATION OF THE CONGRESS TO THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURES

train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0007.flac,AND WHILE THE KNIGHTS DREW REIN IN ASTONISHMENT A LITTLE MAN STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS TO SPEAK TO THEM HE WAS A FAT LITTLE MAN
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0011.flac,AND RIGHT OUT OF HIS OPEN MOUTH CAME THAT TERRIBLE NOISE
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0016.flac,AND LEAD ME TO A PLEASANT PLACE WHERE I MAY REST TO NIGHT ASKED THE KNIGHT AY THAT I CAN
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0017.flac,BUT SIR TRISTRAM TOLD HIM TO RUN AND PROMISED TO WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL HIS RETURN
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0021.flac,AS THE CHILD REACHED DOWN BUT HE SPOKE NO ANGRY WORDS AND WAITED PATIENTLY TILL THE WATER WAS CLEAR AGAIN
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0022.flac,COME AND I WILL CARRY YOU TO THE CHILD AND WHEN THE KNIGHTS FOLLOWED HIM
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0023.flac,AS HAPPY AS A LARK AND AS GENTLE AS A DOVE IT WAS NOONDAY AND THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY ON THE SHIELDS OF THE KNIGHTS AND THEIR PLUMES WERE WAVING IN THE BREEZE
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0025.flac,WHEN THE KNIGHTS SAW GAUVAIN
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0027.flac,IF YOU WILL LET HIM RIDE WITH US TO LIVE AT THE KING'S COURT AND LEARN TO BE A KNIGHT LITTLE GAUVAIN AND HIS MOTHER WERE GREATLY ASTONISHED THEY COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT SUCH A THING HAD HAPPENED
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0028.flac,SHE MUST LIVE WITHOUT HIM THE ROOSTER UP ON THE FENCE CROWED A VERY LOUD
train-clean-360/8011/117866/8011-117866-0032.flac,GAUVAIN HAD A BEAUTIFUL NAME OF HIS OWN THEN
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0001.flac,I SAUNTERED BEHIND THE PRISON BARRACKS I STARED AT THE PALINGS OF THE STOUT PRISON FENCE COUNTING THE MOVERS BUT I HAD NO INCLINATION TO COUNT THEM
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0003.flac,AND CARD PARTIES INSTALLED BESIDE THE PLATFORM BEDS
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0007.flac,HE LOOKED AT ME GLOOMILY HIS EYES FLASHED AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0010.flac,I LIKED TO LIE LIKE THAT A SLEEPING MAN IS NOT MOLESTED AND MEANWHILE ONE CAN DREAM AND THINK BUT I COULD NOT DREAM MY HEART WAS BEATING UNEASILY
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0012.flac,I HAVE SCARCELY ONCE SPOKEN IN PRINT OF MY LIFE IN PRISON THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD I WROTE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN THE CHARACTER OF AN IMAGINARY PERSON
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0014.flac,THESE MEMORIES ROSE UP OF THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT OF MY OWN WILL I SUMMONED THEM
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0015.flac,SOME LITTLE THING AT TIMES UNNOTICED AND THEN BY DEGREES THERE WOULD RISE UP A COMPLETE PICTURE SOME VIVID AND COMPLETE IMPRESSION
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0025.flac,THERE THERE HE SAID TO ME WITH A SLOW ALMOST MOTHERLY SMILE DEAR DEAR WHAT IS THE MATTER THERE COME COME I GRASPED AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NO WOLF
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0027.flac,LOOKING AT HIM TIMIDLY AND INQUIRINGLY WELL DO AND I'LL KEEP WATCH ON YOU AS YOU GO I WON'T LET THE WOLF GET AT YOU
train-clean-360/8011/280922/8011-280922-0031.flac,THOUGH I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND ROSE SUDDENLY TO MY MEMORY WHEN IT WAS WANTED
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0000.flac,THEY RECEIVE A THOUSAND CHARMS FROM THEIR VERY OBSCURITY AND THE FANCY DELIGHTS TO FILL UP THEIR OUTLINES WITH GRACES AND EXCELLENCES OF ITS OWN CREATION
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0002.flac,AND THE FOSTERING CARE OF PROVIDENCE INCREASED AS RAPIDLY AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BURDENED WITH A DOZEN PANNIERS FULL OF THOSE SAGE LAWS USUALLY HEAPED ON THE BACKS OF YOUNG CITIES
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0004.flac,THAT IT IS HIS DUTY TO GO RIGHT WHICH MAKES HIM GO THE VERY REVERSE THE NOBLE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS NATURE REVOLTS AT THIS INTOLERABLE TYRANNY OF LAW
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0010.flac,AND THE LEGEND FURTHER TREATS OF DIVERS MIRACLES WROUGHT BY THE MIGHTY PIPE WHICH THE SAINT HELD IN HIS MOUTH
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0018.flac,WHETHER THIS AWFUL EXAMPLE HAD ANY INFLUENCE OR NOT HISTORY DOES NOT MENTION BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT OUR GRANDMOTHERS WERE MIRACLES OF FIDELITY AND OBEDIENCE
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0021.flac,WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WENT BY THE NAME OF MURDERER'S VALLEY THE LEGEND OF THIS SYLVAN WAR WAS LONG CURRENT AMONG THE NURSES
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0026.flac,MANY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE OWNED A FOOT OF LAND
train-clean-360/8011/291458/8011-291458-0028.flac,WITH WHICH HE COULD SPY UP THE CROOKEDEST RIVER QUITE TO ITS HEAD WATERS
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0000.flac,THE REST OF HIS ANCESTRY BEING ENGLISH OF LONG STANDING IN AMERICA WITH A VERY LITTLE ADMIXTURE OF DUTCH BLOOD HE IS FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN HEIGHT AND HAS BROWN HAIR AND EYES
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0004.flac,M O MET A MAN OF HIS OWN AGE WHO HAD LIVED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE SAME TIME COMPARING NOTES THEY FOUND THAT NEARLY ALL THE SMALL CHILDREN IN IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SUCH PRACTICES
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0009.flac,IN ALL THESE PLAYS HE IS SURE THAT GIRLS TOOK THE INITIATIVE AS OFTEN AS BOYS DID DURING ALL THIS PERIOD
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0010.flac,THIS WAS CONVENTIONAL AMONG THE CHILDREN AND WAS FOSTERED BY THE BANTER OF OLDER PERSONS
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0012.flac,AND THEY TOOK OFF ALL THEIR CLOTHES THE BETTER TO EXAMINE EACH OTHER
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0013.flac,IT CAUSED A SURPRISINGLY KEEN AND DISTINCTLY SEXUAL SENSATION THE FIRST SEXUAL SHOCK THAT HE CAN REMEMBER EXPERIENCING
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0017.flac,THAT WITH HIMSELF THE MAIN CONSIDERATION WAS ALWAYS THE OTHER BOY'S BEAUTY HE BEGAN TO RECALL WITH GREAT FONDNESS
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0020.flac,WHERE THERE WERE ALMOST NO CHILDREN OF HIS OWN AGE
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0021.flac,FROM THIS TIME UNTIL THE CHANGES OF PUBERTY WERE WELL UNDER WAY HIS SEXUAL LIFE CONTRASTED STRONGLY IN ITS SOLITUDE WITH THE FORMER PROMISCUITY
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0026.flac,JUST THEN CERTAIN NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS FELL UNDER HIS EYE AND THESE PERSUADED HIM THAT HE HAD PRODUCED IN HIMSELF A DISEASED CONDITION
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0032.flac,ENJOYING INTERCRURAL INTERCOURSE AND SOMETIMES MUTUAL MASTURBATION THEIR PARENTS MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY UNEASY AT TIMES
train-clean-360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0037.flac,AND OCCASIONALLY WITH OTHERS ON THE WHOLE M O PREFERRED BOYS A YEAR OR TWO YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF BUT AS HE GREW OLDER THE AGE DIFFERENCE INCREASED
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0000.flac,APPENDIX A HOMOSEXUALITY AMONG TRAMPS BY JOSIAH FLYNT
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0006.flac,THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID AND I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO TELL ALL I HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT BUT MERELY TO GIVE A GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0008.flac,A COMMON METHOD IS TO STOP FOR AWHILE IN SOME TOWN AND GAIN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SLUM CHILDREN
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0011.flac,THE TRAMP OF COURSE CONTINUES TO EXCITE HIS IMAGINATION WITH STORIES AND CARESSES AND SOME FINE NIGHT THERE IS ONE BOY LESS IN THE TOWN
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0022.flac,I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE A FEW HOBOES WHO HAVE TAKEN TO BOYS BECAUSE WOMEN ARE SO SCARCE
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0023.flac,FOR EVERY WOMAN IN HOBOLAND THERE ARE A HUNDRED MEN THAT THIS DISPROPORTION HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE POPULARITY OF BOYS IS MADE CLEAR BY THE FOLLOWING CASE
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0027.flac,IF THEY REFUSE TO SUBMIT THEY ARE GAGGED AND HELD DOWN THE SHERIFF SELDOM KNOWS WHAT GOES ON AND FOR THE BOYS TO SAY ANYTHING TO HIM WOULD BE SUICIDAL
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0028.flac,SIMPLY TO BE SURE THAT THEIR PRUSHUNS WERE NOT TOUCHED BY OTHER TRAMPS SUCH ATTACHMENTS FREQUENTLY LAST FOR YEARS AND SOME BOYS REMAIN WITH THEIR FIRST JOCKERS
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0035.flac,BUT FROM WHAT I KNOW OF THEIR DISINCLINATION TO ADOPT THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE PASSION MAY BE DYING OUT SOMEWHAT
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0039.flac,AND THEY SEEM TO LIVE CHIEFLY BY THEMSELVES
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0040.flac,OR AT ALL EVENTS SO NEAR IT
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0041.flac,IN ALL THE LARGE CITIES THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE GLAD TO DO BUSINESS FOR THREE OR FOUR PENCE
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0046.flac,THE TRAMP WHICH PART HE LOOKED TO PERFECTION HE HIMSELF REFERRED TO HIS
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0047.flac,WEASONED FACE AND DIMINUTIVE FORM
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0055.flac,WHO HAVE DONNAS WITH THEM WOMEN ARE NOT AVAILABLE AS PROSTITUTES VERY SELDOM ALLOW INTIMACY FOR
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0056.flac,EXCEPT WHEN DRUNK TRAMPS ARE ALSO AFRAID OF ANY VENEREAL DISEASE AS IT MEANS THE MISERY OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0058.flac,BUT I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE ACTED BOTH ROLES THEN MALE PROSTITUTION IS TO BE HAD FOR NOTHING
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0060.flac,ANOTHER ONE WHO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS ON THE ROAD SAID THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE TO SLEEP ALONE HE WAS A PEDLAR
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0065.flac,AND AS SUCH I WAS EAGERLY COURTED AND ANY SUGGESTION OF INTIMACY ON MY PART QUICKLY RESPONDED TO
train-clean-360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0075.flac,AND IF YOU ARE DANDY TO A SOLDIER IF YOU MAKE ADVANCES OR RECEIVE THEM FROM A SENIOR TROUBLE IS LIKELY TO OCCUR BETWEEN THEM
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0011.flac,HE BLEW FOR JOY UPON THE SILVER HORN HE PRANCED AND CARACOLED
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0013.flac,HE REVELLED THROUGH KINGDOMS TOOK RIVERS IN HIS STRIDE HOW SHALL I TELL YOU YE THAT DWELL IN CITIES
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0016.flac,HISTORY DOES NOT KNOW THEM BUT WHAT OF THAT NOT ALL OF US HAVE SAT AT HISTORIANS FEET BUT ALL HAVE LEARNED FABLE AND MYTH AT THEIR MOTHERS KNEES
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0018.flac,BEFORE DAWN HE ROSE TRIUMPHANT AND HUGELY DRANK OF SOME RIVER IN THE DARK AND SPLASHING OUT OF IT
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0027.flac,SHE WAS MORE MYSTICAL THAN WOMAN HER BEAUTY WAS AS A DREAM WAS AS A SONG THE ONE DREAM OF A LIFETIME DREAMED ON ENCHANTED DEWS
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0031.flac,AND ONLY SEEING DIMLY THROUGH HIS LASHES SEIZED SOMBELENE BY THE HAIR
train-clean-360/803/139743/803-139743-0033.flac,TO BE HER SLAVE FOR ALL CENTURIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO HIS RACE
train-clean-360/803/139752/803-139752-0001.flac,HAS A POSITION EQUAL TO THAT OF MISTER NUTH TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE MAGIC CIRCLE OF BUSINESS
train-clean-360/803/139752/803-139752-0007.flac,ON THE CONTRARY SUCH POLITICS AS I HAVE ARE ON THE SIDE OF PROPERTY AND HE NEEDS NO WORDS FROM ME FOR HIS POSITION IS ALMOST UNIQUE IN TRADE
train-clean-360/803/139753/803-139753-0001.flac,NEVER KNEW THAT IT WAS HE THAT SHOULD COME TO THE ULTIMATE CITY NEVER KNEW THAT HE SHOULD SEE THE UNDER PITS
train-clean-360/803/139753/803-139753-0024.flac,THAT NONE CAN SAY OF THEM WHERE THEIR BOUNDARY IS AND WHICH THE ETERNAL TWILIGHT
train-clean-360/803/139753/803-139753-0029.flac,OR WHETHER IT ROSE FROM THE COASTS OF SOME OTHER WORLD HE DID NOT KNOW HE SAW IT DOMINATE THE CITY OF NEVER AND STROVE TO REACH IT
train-clean-360/803/139753/803-139753-0036.flac,BUT HE AND THE PEOPLE OF THAT TWILIT CITY WELL KNOW TWO THINGS UNGUESSED BY OTHER MEN
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0000.flac,SIR HENRY BASKERVILLE OUR BREAKFAST TABLE WAS CLEARED EARLY AND HOLMES WAITED IN HIS DRESSING GOWN FOR THE PROMISED INTERVIEW
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0004.flac,AND THE STRANGE THING IS MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES THAT IF MY FRIEND HERE HAD NOT PROPOSED COMING ROUND TO YOU THIS MORNING I SHOULD HAVE COME ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0005.flac,PRAY TAKE A SEAT SIR HENRY
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0008.flac,NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN WE ONLY DECIDED AFTER I MET DOCTOR MORTIMER BUT DOCTOR MORTIMER
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0010.flac,OUT OF THE ENVELOPE HE TOOK A HALF SHEET OF FOOLSCAP PAPER FOLDED INTO FOUR THIS HE OPENED AND SPREAD FLAT UPON THE TABLE
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0013.flac,WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT DOCTOR MORTIMER YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL ABOUT THIS AT ANY RATE
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0019.flac,WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT WATSON CRIED HOLMES IN HIGH GLEE RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH SATISFACTION DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS AN ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0026.flac,BUT THAT YOU SHOULD NAME WHICH AND ADD THAT IT CAME FROM THE LEADING ARTICLE IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS WHICH I HAVE EVER KNOWN HOW DID YOU DO IT
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0029.flac,THOUGH I CONFESS THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG I CONFUSED THE LEEDS MERCURY WITH THE WESTERN MORNING NEWS BUT A TIMES LEADER IS ENTIRELY DISTINCTIVE
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0032.flac,IS SO SOMEONE THEN CUT OUT THE MESSAGE WITH A PAIR OF SHORT BLADED SCISSORS PASTED IT WITH PASTE GUM SAID HOLMES
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0033.flac,BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN PRINT
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0038.flac,AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPOSER OF SUCH A LETTER WOULD BE CARELESS IF HE WERE IN A HURRY IT OPENS UP THE INTERESTING QUESTION WHY HE SHOULD BE IN A HURRY
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0042.flac,SHOWING THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INK IN THE BOTTLE NOW A PRIVATE PEN OR INK BOTTLE IS SELDOM ALLOWED TO BE IN SUCH A STATE AND THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO MUST BE QUITE RARE
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0044.flac,UNTIL WE FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE MUTILATED TIMES LEADER WE COULD LAY OUR HANDS STRAIGHT UPON THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS SINGULAR MESSAGE HALLOA HALLOA WHAT'S THIS

train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0056.flac,YOU SEE IF I AM TO BE SQUIRE DOWN THERE I MUST DRESS THE PART AND IT MAY BE THAT I HAVE GOT A LITTLE CARELESS IN MY WAYS OUT WEST
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0058.flac,I CONFESS THAT I SHARE DOCTOR MORTIMER'S BELIEF THAT IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE MISSING BOOT IS FOUND AND NOW GENTLEMEN SAID THE BARONET WITH DECISION
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0064.flac,AND NOW THERE'S THIS AFFAIR OF THE LETTER TO ME AT THE HOTEL I SUPPOSE THAT FITS INTO ITS PLACE
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0067.flac,BUT THE PRACTICAL POINT WHICH WE NOW HAVE TO DECIDE SIR HENRY IS WHETHER IT IS OR IS NOT ADVISABLE FOR YOU TO GO TO BASKERVILLE HALL
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0068.flac,THERE SEEMS TO BE DANGER

train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0070.flac,AND YOU MAY TAKE THAT TO BE MY FINAL ANSWER HIS DARK BROWS KNITTED AND HIS FACE FLUSHED TO A DUSKY RED AS HE SPOKE

train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0080.flac,ONCE OUR FRIENDS STOPPED AND STARED INTO A SHOP WINDOW UPON WHICH HOLMES DID THE SAME AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS HE GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION AND
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0083.flac,AND THE CAB FLEW MADLY OFF DOWN REGENT STREET HOLMES LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND FOR ANOTHER BUT NO EMPTY ONE WAS IN SIGHT
train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0085.flac,WAS EVER SUCH BAD LUCK AND SUCH BAD MANAGEMENT TOO WATSON

train-clean-360/8050/110238/8050-110238-0090.flac,WHEN OUR FRIENDS LEFT I AT ONCE FOLLOWED THEM IN THE HOPES OF MARKING DOWN THEIR INVISIBLE ATTENDANT SO WILY WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT TRUSTED HIMSELF UPON FOOT

train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0013.flac,HAD ALL RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY TOKEN OF APPRECIATION FROM GENJI WHO NOW BEGAN TO HAVE A MANSION REPAIRED
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0014.flac,AND WHICH HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO HIS FATHER THIS HE DID WITH A NOTION OF PLACING THERE SOME OF HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0016.flac,HE REMEMBERED THE PREDICTION OF AN ASTROLOGER WHO HAD TOLD HIM THAT AN EMPEROR WOULD BE BORN TO HIM AND ANOTHER SON WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A DAJIODAIJIN HE ALSO REMEMBERED THAT A DAUGHTER
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0017.flac,WHEN HE REFLECTED ON THIS PREDICTION AND ON THE SERIES OF EVENTS
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0025.flac,THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE MOTHER SEEM ONLY TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE WAS PLACED YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE MATTER TOO SERIOUSLY
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0027.flac,GENJI TRIED TO CONSOLE HER HE TOOK UP A KIN AND ASKED HER TO PLAY AND SING WITH HIM BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT PLAY IT SO WELL AS THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0028.flac,THE FIFTH OF MAY WAS THE FIFTIETH DAY OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SO GENJI SENT A MESSENGER TO AKASHI A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD BE EXPECTED
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0032.flac,BUT GENJI TOOK NO INTEREST IN THIS WHAT WILL HE EVENTUALLY DO ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE SAME AUTUMN GENJI WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF SUMIYOSHI TO FULFIL HIS VOWS
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0035.flac,GENJI WAS IN A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY TEN BOY PAGES GRANTED BY THE COURT IN THE SAME WAY AS A LATE SADAIJIN KAWARA HAD BEEN HONORED
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0037.flac,FOR THE NIGHT AS TO GENJI HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MAIDEN BEING A SPECTATOR OF THE PROCESSION AND SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN THE TEMPLE WITH HIS PARTY IN PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH MIGHT PLEASE THE GOD
train-clean-360/8142/3966/8142-3966-0039.flac,HER HEALTH HOWEVER BEGAN TO FAIL AND SHE BECAME A NUN AND AFTER SOME TIME DIED
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0006.flac,AND FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS NOT VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE FAMILY
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0007.flac,AND WHO STILL REMAINED WITH THE PRINCESS USED TO GO TO HER
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0008.flac,IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHERE A LADY OF ORDINARY DEGREE IS ELEVATED TO A HIGHER POSITION
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0009.flac,BUT THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN WHO WHEN DEGRADED FROM THEIR RANK SPOIL THEIR TASTE AND HABITS JUST LIKE THE LADY IN QUESTION

train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0016.flac,BUT IT IS SIMPLY FOOLISH TO ABANDON ONE'S SELF AND TO BURY ONE'S LIFE UNDER SUCH A MASS OF DILAPIDATION
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0017.flac,ALL HIS OLD FAVORITES BEING NOW ABANDONED HOW THEN CAN YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO HIM
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0018.flac,THESE WORDS TOUCHED THE PRINCESS BUT SHE GAVE NO VENT TO HER FEELINGS THE VISITOR THEREFORE HURRIED JIJIU TO GET READY SAYING THAT THEY MUST LEAVE BEFORE THE DUSK
train-clean-360/8142/3967/8142-3967-0019.flac,THAT ALSO SEEMS NATURAL

train-clean-360/8742/245707/8742-245707-0040.flac,BOTH BECAUSE MATTER CONSIDERED IN ITSELF IS QUITE UNCHANGEABLE SINCE IT HAS A POTENTIAL EXISTENCE AND HAS NOTHING BUT THE NATURE OF A SUBJECT
train-clean-360/8742/245707/8742-245707-0041.flac,WE MUST ADMIT AN ADDITION OF MATTER EITHER BY CREATION

train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0003.flac,WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS NOT IN MAN FOR IT IS WRITTEN

train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0010.flac,IS NOT CALLED AN IMAGE OF THE OTHER EGG BECAUSE IT IS NOT COPIED FROM IT BUT EQUALITY DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ESSENCE OF AN IMAGE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0013.flac,FOR SUCH AN EXEMPLAR INFINITELY EXCELS ITS COPY THEREFORE THERE IS IN MAN A LIKENESS TO GOD NOT INDEED A PERFECT LIKENESS BUT IMPERFECT
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0014.flac,AND SCRIPTURE IMPLIES THE SAME WHEN IT SAYS THAT MAN WAS MADE TO GOD'S LIKENESS FOR THE PREPOSITION TO SIGNIFIES A CERTAIN APPROACH AS OF SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0016.flac,THE FIRST BORN OF CREATURES IS THE PERFECT IMAGE OF GOD REFLECTING PERFECTLY THAT OF WHICH HE IS THE IMAGE AND SO HE IS SAID TO BE THE IMAGE AND NEVER TO THE IMAGE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0022.flac,BUT GOD IS THE CAUSE NOT ONLY OF RATIONAL BUT ALSO OF IRRATIONAL CREATURES THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0023.flac,FURTHER THE MORE DISTINCT A LIKENESS IS THE NEARER IT APPROACHES TO THE NATURE OF AN IMAGE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0025.flac,THEREFORE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD AND NOT ONLY MAN

train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0030.flac,THUS THE IMAGE OF THE KING EXISTS IN HIS SON OR AT LEAST IN SOME SPECIFIC ACCIDENT AND CHIEFLY IN THE SHAPE THUS WE SPEAK OF A MAN'S IMAGE IN COPPER
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0032.flac,SECONDLY BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND THIRDLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW OR UNDERSTAND AND THESE LAST AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0034.flac,SO DIONYSIUS SAYS THAT EFFECTS ARE CONTINGENT IMAGES OF THEIR CAUSES THAT IS AS MUCH AS THEY HAPPEN CONTINGIT TO BE SO BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0035.flac,DIONYSIUS COMPARES THE SOLAR RAY TO DIVINE GOODNESS AS REGARDS ITS CAUSALITY NOT AS REGARDS ITS NATURAL DIGNITY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE IDEA OF AN IMAGE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0038.flac,WE DO NOT MEAN THAT THE UNIVERSE IN ANY PART IS NOT TO GOD'S IMAGE BUT THAT THE OTHER PARTS ARE EXCLUDED
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0040.flac,WHETHER THE ANGELS ARE MORE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD THAN MAN IS OBJECTION ONE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0041.flac,FURTHER ACCORDING TO AUGUSTINE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0042.flac,THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE NOT MORE TO THE IMAGE OF GOD THAN MAN
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0049.flac,FURTHER LIKENESS BELONGS TO THE NATURE OF THE IMAGE AS ABOVE EXPLAINED
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0050.flac,BUT BY SIN MAN BECOMES UNLIKE GOD THEREFORE HE LOSES THE IMAGE OF GOD ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0051.flac,SURELY MAN PASSETH AS AN IMAGE I ANSWER THAT SINCE MAN IS SAID TO BE THE IMAGE OF GOD BY REASON OF HIS INTELLECTUAL NATURE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0053.flac,WHEREFORE WE SEE THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN IN THREE WAYS FIRST INASMUCH AS MAN POSSESSES A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR UNDERSTANDING AND LOVING GOD
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0058.flac,THESE REASONS REFER TO THE IMAGE CONSISTING IN THE CONFORMITY OF GRACE AND GLORY FIFTH ARTICLE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0060.flac,AND ONE IS THE IMAGE TO WHICH MAN WAS MADE AND HILARY
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0061.flac,THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN IS OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE AND NOT OF THE TRINITY OF PERSONS
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0062.flac,FURTHER IT IS SAID DE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0063.flac,THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN REGARDS NOT THE TRINITY OF PERSONS BUT THE UNITY OF THE ESSENCE
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0065.flac,IT FOLLOWS THAT BY HIS NATURAL KNOWLEDGE MAN COULD KNOW THE TRINITY OF THE DIVINE PERSONS WHICH IS UNTRUE AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE QUESTION THIRTY TWO
train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0066.flac,FURTHER THE NAME OF IMAGE IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ANY OF THE THREE PERSONS BUT ONLY TO THE SON FOR AUGUSTINE SAYS

train-clean-360/8742/245708/8742-245708-0072.flac,SOME HAVE SAID THAT IN MAN THERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE SON ONLY AUGUSTINE REJECTS THIS OPINION

train-clean-360/984/137141/984-137141-0044.flac,AND NOTHING ON EARTH WOULD INDUCE ME TO READ IT I ADD ONE PURELY PEDANTIC NOTE WHICH COMES AS A NOTE NATURALLY SHOULD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0000.flac,THE ROMANCE OF ORTHODOXY

train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0022.flac,MORE SUPERNATURAL THINGS ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR TIME THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE EIGHTY YEARS AGO MEN OF SCIENCE BELIEVE IN SUCH MARVELS MUCH MORE THAN THEY DID
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0028.flac,OF THE FACT AND EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL I WILL SPEAK AFTERWARDS HERE WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THIS CLEAR POINT
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0035.flac,FOR INSTANCE MISTER BERNARD SHAW SPEAKS WITH HEARTY OLD FASHIONED CONTEMPT FOR THE IDEA OF MIRACLES
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0037.flac,HOW CAN IT BE NOBLE TO WISH TO MAKE ONE'S LIFE INFINITE AND YET MEAN TO WISH TO MAKE IT IMMORTAL NO IF IT IS DESIRABLE THAT MAN SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER THE CRUELTY OF NATURE OR CUSTOM
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0039.flac,OR RATHER OF A CERTAIN MODERN ATTITUDE WHICH IS OFTEN CALLED IMMANENTISM AND WHICH OFTEN IS BUDDHISM BUT THIS IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT A MATTER THAT I MUST APPROACH IT WITH RATHER MORE PREPARATION
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0040.flac,HERE IS A CASE THERE IS A PHRASE OF FACILE LIBERALITY UTTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN AT ETHICAL SOCIETIES AND PARLIAMENTS OF RELIGION

train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0048.flac,BUT THEY ARE CAUTIOUS IN THEIR PRAISES OF MAHOMMEDANISM GENERALLY CONFINING THEMSELVES TO IMPOSING ITS MORALITY ONLY UPON THE REFRESHMENT OF THE LOWER CLASSES
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0058.flac,EVEN WHEN I THOUGHT WITH MOST OTHER WELL INFORMED THOUGH UNSCHOLARLY PEOPLE THAT BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY WERE ALIKE THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT THEM THAT ALWAYS PERPLEXED ME
train-clean-360/984/137154/984-137154-0060.flac,THE OPPOSITION EXISTS AT EVERY POINT BUT PERHAPS THE SHORTEST STATEMENT OF IT IS THAT THE BUDDHIST SAINT ALWAYS HAS HIS EYES SHUT
